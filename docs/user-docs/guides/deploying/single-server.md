# Single-Server Deployment

Run Trinity on a Linux VPS or dedicated server with a stable URL. Two install methods share one `.env` contract, one installer and one set of day-two procedures:

- **Option A — prebuilt images** (`./scripts/deploy/start.sh --hosted`): every platform image and the agent base image are pulled from GHCR. A fresh VM is serving in about two minutes. **This is the path you want on a server.**
- **Option B — build from source** (`docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml`): the server compiles its own images, including the ~1.9 GB agent base image (5–10 minutes). Use it when you carry local patches or the enterprise overlay.

Both use the production compose shape: no hot-reload, health checks and `unless-stopped` restart policies on every service, Redis off the agent network. Two more paths are Option A on a DigitalOcean Droplet: the [Marketplace 1-Click](#digitalocean-marketplace-1-click) (a snapshot with the images already pulled) and the [installer script](#digitalocean-installer-script) (creates a stock Droplet from your terminal). Both provision Docker, Caddy with an HTTPS certificate for the Droplet's own IP, and a host firewall before running the same `start.sh --hosted`.

## Prerequisites

- Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later recommended), **8 GB RAM minimum** — below that the agent containers and the platform services contend and turns start failing under load
- Docker Engine 24+ and the Docker Compose plugin (`docker compose` — no hyphen)
- A domain or subdomain pointing to your server's IP (e.g., `trinity.your-domain.com`), or a plan for private access — see [TLS on a bare VM](#tls-on-a-bare-vm)
- `openssl` on the server for secret generation
- Outbound HTTPS access from the server (image pulls from `ghcr.io`, Anthropic API calls)

## Which compose files go together

Trinity ships **three complete stacks**, not one base file plus overlays. `docker-compose.prod.yml` and `docker-compose.hosted.yml` are standalone: each restates the hardening (`security_opt`, `group_add`, `cap_drop`) because nothing else supplies it.

| Install | Command | Where `/data` lives |
|---|---|---|
| Dev (source build, localhost) | `./scripts/deploy/start.sh` — i.e. `docker compose up -d` (auto-merges `docker-compose.override.yml` if present) | named volume `trinity-data` |
| Production (source build) | `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` (+ `-f docker-compose.prod.enterprise.yml` with the enterprise submodule) | bind mount `${TRINITY_DATA_PATH:-./trinity-data}` |
| Hosted (prebuilt GHCR images) | `./scripts/deploy/start.sh --hosted` — day-two: `docker compose -f docker-compose.hosted.yml …` | bind mount `${TRINITY_DATA_PATH:-./trinity-data}` |

The remaining files are narrow overlays and never a third stack: `docker-compose.override.example.yml` (the Docker Desktop Vector log source — `start.sh` copies it to `docker-compose.override.yml` on Docker Desktop and appends it by name under `--hosted`), `docker-compose.gitea.yml` (dev-only: a local Gitea for git-sync testing, layered on the dev file), `docker-compose.prod.enterprise.yml` (layers the private enterprise submodule onto prod), and `docker-compose.sibling.yml` (a Redis-only stack for integration tests).

**Never stack the dev file under prod or hosted** (`-f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml`). Compose concatenates list-type keys, so the combination either fails validation on the duplicated hardening entries (Compose ≥ 2.24) or, on older versions, silently gives the frontend two host mappings for one port and it never joins its network.

**Never run a bare `docker compose up -d` on a production host.** It loads the dev file, whose `/data` is the named volume, and boots a healthy-looking backend on an empty database while the real one sits untouched in `TRINITY_DATA_PATH`. `start.sh` refuses this crossing in both directions and prints the file set the host was installed with (`quickstart.sh` is an alias for `start.sh`, so it inherits the refusal). If both stores already exist — the state a wrong-file start leaves behind — `start.sh` warns which one it is about to use rather than staying silent.

## Option A: Prebuilt images (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abilityai/trinity.git && cd trinity
cp .env.example .env
# Set ADMIN_PASSWORD, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, FRONTEND_URL / PUBLIC_CHAT_URL, and an email provider (see the .env sections below)

# Pin the release you want, in .env — `latest` moves on every Trinity release,
# so an unpinned install turns your next re-run into an unscheduled upgrade.
echo 'TRINITY_IMAGE_TAG=v0.9.0' >> .env

./scripts/deploy/start.sh --hosted --unattended
```

What `--hosted` changes, and nothing else:

- **Compose file.** `docker-compose.hosted.yml` — `docker-compose.prod.yml` with every `build:` block replaced by a GHCR `image:` reference. Same ports, volumes, networks, `.env` keys and security posture; a CI guard fails the build if the two files ever disagree.
- **Image tag.** `TRINITY_IMAGE_TAG` selects the image set (default `latest`). Precedence: a value in the shell or CI → `.env` → `latest`. Put it in `.env`: that is where the pin survives a reboot and whoever runs the next upgrade. Each release publishes `v0.9.0`, `0.9.0`, `0.9`, `latest` and `sha-<short>` for one digest, so either version spelling works. A pre-release tag (for example `v0.9.5-rc1`) publishes its own tags but never moves `latest`.
- **Image source.** `TRINITY_IMAGE_REGISTRY` selects whose images are pulled (default `ghcr.io/abilityai`, same precedence as the tag). Every image resolves to `${TRINITY_IMAGE_REGISTRY}/<image>:${TRINITY_IMAGE_TAG}`, so a Docker Hub namespace is just the username — `TRINITY_IMAGE_REGISTRY=youruser` pulls `youruser/trinity-backend`. For a private repository run `docker login` (Docker Hub) or `docker login <registry-host>` first. To publish your own images from a fork, set the repository secrets `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` (a Docker Hub access token with Read & Write), then push a `v*` tag or run **Publish images** manually; optional repository variables `DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE` (an organization instead of the username) and `PUBLISH_GHCR=true` (also push to GHCR).
- **Agent base image.** The backend creates agent containers from the local tag `trinity-agent-base:latest`, which is not a compose service. `start.sh --hosted` pulls `${TRINITY_IMAGE_REGISTRY}/trinity-agent-base:<tag>` and tags it locally before bringing the stack up. A bare `docker compose -f docker-compose.hosted.yml up -d` starts a platform that cannot create a single agent and does not fail until the first agent-create.
- **No fallback to building.** A failed pull is fatal and the message names the likely causes: the tag is not published (check the release list), the GHCR package is private (`denied` / `unauthorized` — a publishing fault, report it), or no route to `ghcr.io`. Drop `--hosted` to build from source instead.
- **Tunnel.** A non-empty `TUNNEL_TOKEN` in `.env` starts the `cloudflared` service (`--profile tunnel`) and persists `COMPOSE_PROFILES=tunnel` to `.env`, so later bare `docker compose -f docker-compose.hosted.yml stop` / `logs` commands act on the tunnel container too. See [Public Access](public-access.md).
- **Build provenance.** Not stamped from your checkout — `GET /api/version` reports the commit the release workflow built.

Everything else — secret generation, the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` contract, `DOCKER_GID` detection, the data-directory ownership fix, the 180-second serving poll and the next-steps card — is the same `start.sh` behaviour described in [Local Development → Start Services](local-development.md#4-start-services).

**Pull-only means it does not build — not that it needs nothing on disk.** The hosted compose mounts `./config/agent-templates`, `./config/process-templates`, `./config/process-docs`, `./config/manifests`, `./config/vector.yaml` and `./config/otel-collector.yaml` from the checkout, and `/data` is the `${TRINITY_DATA_PATH:-./trinity-data}` bind mount. Handed to a managed host or a compose catalogue without the repository, Docker creates each of those as an empty directory: the template catalog is empty and the first-run starter fleet finds no manifest, with no error at install time. Keep the checkout beside the compose file.

**Converting an existing source install in place is not a drop-in.** The dev stack keeps `/data` in the named volume `trinity-data`; hosted (like prod) binds `${TRINITY_DATA_PATH:-./trinity-data}`. `start.sh --hosted` detects a dev volume with no bind-mount database, refuses, and prints the copy command (`docker compose stop`, then copy the volume contents into the directory, then re-run). Set `TRINITY_DATA_PATH` to a new directory to deliberately start fresh.

Day-two commands on a hosted install (note the explicit `-f` — hosted opts out of compose's default file merge):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.hosted.yml ps
docker compose -f docker-compose.hosted.yml logs -f backend
./scripts/deploy/stop.sh                       # runs `stop`, never `down`; detects the hosted file itself
./scripts/deploy/start.sh --hosted             # start again — and the upgrade command (see Upgrading)
```

Upgrading a hosted install is a re-run of `start.sh --hosted` with a new `TRINITY_IMAGE_TAG`, never a bare `docker compose pull` (which skips the agent base image and leaves agents on the old runtime) — see [Upgrading → Hosted installs](upgrading.md#hosted-pull-only-installs).

## Option B: Build from source

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abilityai/trinity.git
cd trinity
```

### 2. Configure `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

`start.sh` has no production-compose mode: without `--hosted` it starts the **dev** stack. A source-built production install is therefore brought up with `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml` directly, and you generate the secrets yourself. Every variable in the tables below is forwarded by `docker-compose.prod.yml` (and by the hosted file — the two agree by construction).

#### Security-critical (must be set before first boot)

| Variable | How to generate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | `openssl rand -hex 32` | JWT signing key. Never reuse across instances. |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Choose a strong password | Minimum 12 characters. Drives both `admin` login and the MCP server's legacy auth path. **Required** — `docker-compose.prod.yml` refuses to render if it is unset or blank. (`docker-compose.hosted.yml` refuses only an unset one; a blank is accepted solely for the marketplace browser-claim path, marked `ADMIN_PASSWORD_SOURCE=browser`.) |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | Optional, default `admin` | The admin account's username. Forwarded by all three compose files. |
| `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `openssl rand -hex 32` | Encrypts OAuth tokens, channel bot tokens, subscription credentials and the credential-bearing platform settings. **If lost, all encrypted credentials become unrecoverable.** |
| `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` | `openssl rand -hex 32` | Authenticates scheduler-to-backend calls. Set it explicitly — do not rely on the `SECRET_KEY` fallback. |
| `AGENT_AUTH_SECRET` | `openssl rand -hex 32` | Master secret the backend derives each agent's in-container auth token from. **Never rotate** — every running agent's token stops working until the agent is recreated. |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | `openssl rand -hex 24` | Admin/`default` ACL user. Used for recovery and ad-hoc ops. |
| `REDIS_BACKEND_PASSWORD` | `openssl rand -hex 24` | Runtime ACL user for `backend` and `scheduler` containers. Embedded in `REDIS_URL` at compose render time. **Required** — compose refuses to render without it. |
| `DOCKER_GID` | GID of `/var/run/docker.sock` as a container sees it | Compose falls back to `999` (the Debian/Ubuntu `docker` group). Set it if your host's socket group differs (`stat -c '%g' /var/run/docker.sock`); `start.sh` detects it for hosted installs. |

Generate the hex secrets at once:

```bash
echo "SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
echo "CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
echo "INTERNAL_API_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
echo "AGENT_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
echo "REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
echo "REDIS_BACKEND_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
```

Paste the output into `.env`.

#### Redis security note

Trinity uses two separate Redis passwords by design. `REDIS_BACKEND_PASSWORD` is the runtime credential embedded in `REDIS_URL` for the `backend` and `scheduler` containers. Even if a platform container were compromised and this password leaked, it does **not** grant access to destructive Redis commands (`FLUSHALL`, `CONFIG`, `SHUTDOWN`, etc.) — those require `REDIS_PASSWORD`. See `docs/migrations/REDIS_AUTH.md` for details on the ACL design.

#### Required for agent functionality

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Required for agents to run Claude. Can be left blank and configured in Settings after login (or connect a Claude subscription there). |
| `GITHUB_PAT` | Required to clone private GitHub template repos. |

#### Required for production access

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Your public-facing domain (e.g., `https://trinity.your-domain.com`). Used for OAuth redirect callbacks and email verification links. |
| `PUBLIC_CHAT_URL` | The externally reachable URL for public chat links and webhooks. Often the same as `FRONTEND_URL`. Leave blank if all users access via VPN. |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Host port the web UI binds (default `80`). Honoured by the prod and hosted compose files as well as dev. |
| `TRINITY_DATA_PATH` | Bind-mount directory for `/data` (see [Data path](#data-path)). |

#### Email authentication

Email login is enabled by default. Set at least one email provider:

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` | `resend` (recommended), `sendgrid`, `smtp`, or `console` (logs codes — dev only). `.env.example` ships `console`; the compose default when the line is absent is `resend`. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Required when `EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend`. Get from [resend.com](https://resend.com/api-keys). |
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | Required when `EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid`. |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` / `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Required when `EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp`. |
| `SMTP_FROM` | From address for verification emails (e.g., `noreply@your-domain.com`). |

#### Optional integrations

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` / `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` / `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Slack OAuth and channel adapter. The client id/secret are read by the prod and hosted files only. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google Workspace OAuth. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth (prod and hosted only). |
| `NOTION_CLIENT_ID` / `NOTION_CLIENT_SECRET` | Notion OAuth (prod and hosted only). |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Platform image generation, voice chat, voice transcription. |
| `TUNNEL_TOKEN` | Cloudflare Tunnel token — see [Public Access](public-access.md). |

#### Data path

The prod and hosted compose files use a bind-mount directory for `trinity.db` instead of a named Docker volume:

```
TRINITY_DATA_PATH=./trinity-data
```

The default `./trinity-data` is relative to the repo root. Use an absolute path on a server for clarity:

```
TRINITY_DATA_PATH=/srv/trinity-data
```

Create the directory before starting, owned by UID 1000 (the backend and scheduler run as a non-root user and cannot create `trinity.db` in a root-owned directory; `start.sh` does this step for hosted installs):

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/trinity-data && sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /srv/trinity-data
```

The automatic database backups land in `backups/` under this directory — see [Backup and Restore](backup-and-restore.md).

#### Database backend

Trinity stores platform state in **SQLite** by default, in `trinity.db` under your `TRINITY_DATA_PATH` bind mount (`/data/trinity.db` inside the container). SQLite works with zero configuration — but **PostgreSQL is the recommended backend for production**, and **SQLite support ends September 1, 2026** (after that date it stops receiving schema migrations and fixes).

To run on PostgreSQL, set one variable in `.env`:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://trinity:your-postgres-password@your-db-host:5432/trinity
```

Both the backend and the scheduler pick it up (`DB_POOL_SIZE` and `DB_MAX_OVERFLOW` tune the pool; both default sensibly). Notes for the prod and hosted compose:

- Neither ships a **bundled PostgreSQL service** — point `DATABASE_URL` at an operator-managed instance (a managed cloud database or your own PostgreSQL server). The bundled `--profile postgres` container exists only in the dev compose.
- Selection is non-sticky and non-destructive: comment `DATABASE_URL` out and the next restart is back on SQLite.
- A fresh PostgreSQL database is initialized automatically on first boot (Alembic-managed migrations).
- **Migrating an existing SQLite instance?** Use the Trinity Ops Agent's `/migrate-to-postgres` skill ([ops-agent guide](ops-agent.md)) — a validate-then-cutover flow that never writes to your SQLite file, so rollback is one line. New-instance setup details: `docs/POSTGRESQL_SETUP.md` in the repo.
- On PostgreSQL, the automatic backups are `pg_dump` archives, and a manual backup is `pg_dump` too — never a copy of `trinity.db`. See [Backup and Restore](backup-and-restore.md).

On every backend boot, a versioned migration runner brings the schema up to date (the bespoke SQLite runner or Alembic for PostgreSQL). The runner is crash-safe and concurrency-safe: a cross-process lock serialises it so multiple workers and the scheduler cannot race each other, and table rebuilds run inside a transaction that rolls back cleanly on a mid-migration crash. If a migration is still pending or has failed, the backend's `/health` endpoint returns `503` with a `migrations` block (`applied`, `expected`, `first_pending`) naming the stuck migration — so a 503 from `curl http://localhost:8000/health` during an upgrade is actionable, not opaque. Before any migration runs, the backend takes a `pre-migration-<timestamp>.db` copy (SQLite) into `backups/`.

### 3. Build the Base Agent Image

```bash
./scripts/deploy/build-base-image.sh
```

This builds `trinity-agent-base:latest` — the image every agent container inherits. Required before you can create any agents. Takes 5–10 minutes on first build.

### 4. Build and Start Platform Services

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

This starts: `backend`, `frontend`, `redis`, `mcp-server`, `scheduler`, `vector`, and `otel-collector`, plus a one-shot `trinity-logs-init` container that prepares the log directory and exits.

The `cloudflared` tunnel service is **not started** by default — it requires an explicit `--profile tunnel` flag. See [Public Access](public-access.md).

## First Login

Open your domain (or `http://your-server-ip`, or `http://your-server-ip:$FRONTEND_PORT`) in a browser. Log in with:
- **Username:** `admin` (or `ADMIN_USERNAME` if you changed it)
- **Password:** the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set in `.env` (re-applied on every backend boot — change it there, not in the UI, then recreate the backend container with `docker compose -f <file> up -d backend`; a plain `restart` does not re-read `.env`)

There is no setup wizard on a server install: setting `ADMIN_PASSWORD` provisions the admin account during startup, and the unauthenticated first-run form refuses to run once a usable admin exists. The one exception is a Marketplace 1-Click Droplet created without a password, which deliberately boots with no admin and is claimed in the browser — see [DigitalOcean 1-Click](#digitalocean-marketplace-1-click). What you see instead is the Dashboard with a fresh install's starter fleet and the first-run setup sequence — a **Sign-in email** step (so you can log in with email + password), the required **Connect Claude** step, and optional keys — see [First-Time Setup](../../getting-started/setup.md).

After login, go to **Settings → Access → Email Whitelist** to allow team members to log in via email verification.

## Connect from Claude Code

Create an MCP API key:
1. Log in to the web UI
2. Go to **Settings → MCP Keys**
3. Create a new key and copy it

Then connect from your Claude Code session:

```bash
/trinity:connect
# URL: https://trinity.your-domain.com/mcp   (the production frontend proxies /mcp to the MCP server)
#      or http://your-server:8080/mcp        (the MCP server's own port, where it is reachable)
# API Key: (your MCP API key)
```

The `/mcp` proxy on the production nginx means an install that exposes only ports 80/443 — a tunnel, a reverse proxy, the DigitalOcean 1-Click — still serves MCP at the same hostname as the web UI. **Settings → MCP Keys → MCP Server URL** sets the URL the UI shows to users; leave it empty to derive it from the hostname.

## Restart vs. Down

> **Use `docker compose restart`, not `down/up`.** `docker compose down` removes the `trinity-agent-network`, which orphans every running agent container — they keep running but lose their network and have to be removed and recreated. `restart` preserves both the agents and the network. The only times to use `down` are: (1) intentional full teardown, (2) recovering from a corrupted compose state.

```bash
# Correct way to restart platform services
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart backend frontend mcp-server scheduler
# Hosted installs
docker compose -f docker-compose.hosted.yml restart backend frontend mcp-server scheduler

# Full stop (agents will need to be restarted/recreated)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
```

Since agent containers are created with Docker's `unless-stopped` restart policy, a `down` no longer leaves them merely orphaned: dockerd retries each one in a backoff loop against a network that no longer exists, and the roster shows them as stopped while it churns. Recovery: `docker compose -f <file> up -d` (recreates the network), then `docker rm -f` each stale agent container and start it again from the UI (or **Fleet Restart** on the mobile admin page, which restarts every running agent) — the workspace volume holds the agent's data and is untouched by a container removal.

`./scripts/deploy/stop.sh` runs `stop`, never `down`, and reads the running stack's compose label to pick `docker-compose.hosted.yml` when needed. It does **not** detect a source-built production stack — on one of those, use the explicit `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop`.

### Host reboots

Every platform service carries `restart: unless-stopped`, and so does every agent container Trinity creates, so a host reboot brings the whole fleet back. An agent you stopped on purpose (Stop, quarantine, emergency stop) stays stopped — that is the difference between `unless-stopped` and `always`. Agent containers created before this policy shipped keep Docker's default (`no`) until they are recreated; the one-shot sweep is in [Upgrading → Agent restart policy](upgrading.md#agent-restart-policy-one-time-after-upgrading).

## Verify Service Health

After starting, verify all services are healthy:

```bash
# Backend
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health

# Scheduler
curl -s http://localhost:8001/health

# Frontend
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost

# Redis
docker exec trinity-redis redis-cli ping

# MCP Server
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health

# Vector
docker exec trinity-vector wget -q -O - http://localhost:8686/health
```

The scheduler's port 8001 is not published to the host by either server compose file — probe it from inside the container instead: `docker exec trinity-scheduler curl -sf http://localhost:8001/health`. See [monitoring.md](monitoring.md) for the full monitoring guide.

## TLS on a bare VM

Trinity serves plain HTTP and terminates TLS **outside** the application. There is no HTTPS listener in any compose file and no auto-certificate step, so pick one of these before putting an instance on a public address:

| Path | What it gives you | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| **Tunnel** (Cloudflare Tunnel — set `TUNNEL_TOKEN` in `.env`) | HTTPS at a real hostname, no inbound ports open at all | The default for a public instance. Nothing to renew. |
| **Private network** (Tailscale / WireGuard / VPC) | Encrypted transport, instance not on the public internet | HTTP over a WireGuard tunnel is encrypted — this is a finished posture, not a compromise. |
| **Reverse proxy you run** (Caddy / nginx + Let's Encrypt) | HTTPS at your own domain | You already operate a proxy, or you need a domain the tunnel can't serve. |

Plain HTTP on a public IPv4 with none of the above is the one combination to avoid: credentials and JWTs cross the network in the clear. A provisioned DigitalOcean Droplet — the 1-Click or the installer script below — is the deliberate exception: it ships its own Caddy with a short-lived certificate for the Droplet's IP, and the first-run setup then prompts you to add a domain and a tunnel. Tunnel setup: [Public Access](public-access.md).

## DigitalOcean Marketplace 1-Click

The Trinity 1-Click is a Droplet image with Docker, Caddy, ufw and a pinned Trinity release already pulled — Option A baked into a snapshot, so first boot pulls nothing.

Prefer to choose the admin password and hand over a Claude subscription before the Droplet exists? `trinity-do-create.sh` gives the same result from your own terminal — see [Deploy on DigitalOcean](digitalocean.md). The sections below (first boot, sign-in, managing the Droplet) apply to both, with four differences: an installer Droplet has its admin account from first boot, takes about six minutes rather than ninety seconds (it installs and pulls everything on first boot), records `do-script` instead of `do-marketplace` as its provenance, and has no login banner.

### Sizing

| Use case | RAM | vCPU | Boot disk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum — platform plus 1–2 agents | 4 GB | 2 | 50 GB |
| **Recommended** — a working fleet | **8 GB** | **4** | **80 GB** |
| Larger fleets | 16 GB+ | 8+ | 160 GB+ |

The baked images occupy a significant share of the disk before any agent exists; agent workspaces grow from there. Disk can be increased on a running Droplet, never decreased.

### What first boot does

First boot runs once per Droplet, about ninety seconds, with no input from you:

1. **Admin account** — **none is created.** Unless you supplied a password through user-data (below), `ADMIN_PASSWORD` stays blank and `ADMIN_PASSWORD_SOURCE=browser` records that this is deliberate; the first person to open the instance creates the admin in the browser. Nothing is generated, so nothing is printed.
2. **`.env`** — written at `/opt/trinity/.env` with `FRONTEND_PORT=8081` (the web UI moves off `:80` so Caddy can own 80/443), `TRINITY_IMAGE_TAG=<the baked release>`, `TRINITY_INSTALL_SOURCE=do-marketplace` (the install-provenance marker) and `FRONTEND_URL=https://<droplet-ip>`. `start.sh` generates the remaining secrets as on any install.
3. **Firewall** — ufw allows 22, 80 and 443 only. Docker publishes container ports past ufw, so a separate `DOCKER-USER` rule set (re-applied by a systemd unit on every boot) drops **everything** arriving at a container from off-box, whatever the port — there is no port list to keep in step with the compose file. It also blocks containers from reaching the cloud metadata service, so an agent cannot read the Droplet's user-data. Everything you use is served by Caddy on 80/443.
4. **Caddy** — a Caddyfile for `https://<droplet-ip>` with a Let's Encrypt short-lived IP certificate (about six days, renewed automatically), reverse-proxying to the web UI on `127.0.0.1:8081`; `http://` redirects to `https://`. A second catch-all site issues a certificate on demand for the domain you later save as the Public URL (and refuses every other name). First boot verifies the IP certificate was actually issued and records the result — the login banner prints `http://` if it was not.
5. **Trinity** — `./scripts/deploy/start.sh --hosted --unattended` from `/opt/trinity`.

### Claim the admin account

Open `https://<droplet-ip>` as soon as the Droplet is up. You land on a **Create your admin account** form: enter your email (it becomes your sign-in identity), choose a password (12+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, a digit and a special character), and you are signed straight in. No terminal, no console, no password to copy.

> **The window between creating the Droplet and that first visit is the accepted risk of this path: anyone who finds the IP first can claim the instance.** It holds nothing at that moment and can simply be destroyed and recreated. To keep the window short, open the URL right after creating the Droplet (first boot takes about ninety seconds), or restrict port 443 to your own IP with a cloud firewall until you have claimed it (leave 80 open — Let's Encrypt validates the IP certificate over it, and it serves only a redirect). If a Droplet you have never opened shows the **login** page instead of the form, someone else got there first: destroy it and create another.

To skip the claim window, choose the password before first boot. Paste this into **Additional Options → Startup scripts** when creating the Droplet:

```yaml
#cloud-config
write_files:
  - path: /etc/trinity/admin-password
    permissions: '0600'
    content: "your-password-here"
```

It must be `#cloud-config` with `write_files`, not a shell script — a shell script runs after first boot has already started Trinity. The file is shredded once the password has been read, the admin is provisioned at boot, and the form never appears; sign in as `admin` with that password. (The [installer script](#digitalocean-installer-script) does the same from your terminal.)

The login banner (Droplet → Console) prints the URL to open, whether HTTPS came up, and which of the two paths this Droplet took — never a password.

### Sign in and harden

The certificate is a real Let's Encrypt certificate for the IP address, so there is no browser warning.

**Passwords.** On a Droplet claimed in the browser, `.env` keeps `ADMIN_PASSWORD` blank on purpose — the password lives only in the database, and reboots and `start.sh --hosted` upgrades leave it alone. There is no change-password form in the UI. To change or reset the password on any Droplet, set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `/opt/trinity/.env` and re-run `./scripts/deploy/start.sh --hosted` (or `docker compose -f docker-compose.hosted.yml up -d backend`); the backend adopts the value on the next boot. A plain `restart` does not re-read `.env`.

Because the install recorded `do-marketplace` as its provenance, the first-run setup that opens on the Dashboard begins with a **Secure this instance** step for admins. It is a two-stage upgrade prompt, not a breakage warning:

1. **Give it a real name** — point a domain's A record at the Droplet, then save it as the **Public URL** on the step itself (the same field lives in **Settings → General**). Caddy on the Droplet obtains a Let's Encrypt certificate for that name the first time someone visits it — give DNS a moment to settle — so adding a domain is a Settings field and nothing else. Trinity then hands out the name instead of the IP. Saving a domain completes the step.
2. **Serve it without exposing it** — with that domain on Cloudflare, a Cloudflare Tunnel lets the server stop listening on the public internet while inbound integrations (Telegram, WhatsApp, VoIP, public agent links, webhook triggers) keep working. Set `TUNNEL_TOKEN` in `/opt/trinity/.env` and re-run `start.sh --hosted` — see [Public Access](public-access.md). This stage is guidance only and optional.

The step describes only what the instance *advertises* (the configured Public URL); nothing inspects a certificate or opens a socket. Skipping it is remembered per browser; re-open the sequence any time from **Settings → General → Re-run setup** or by adding `?onboarding=1` to the Dashboard URL. Provenance itself is recorded once at first boot and cannot be edited afterwards — the marker in `.env` is never re-read, and the API refuses to write or clear it — so the step never appears on an install that was not provisioned this way.

Connect a Claude credential in the **Connect Claude** step (the one required step; it is also under **Settings → Integrations**), then create your first agent — the seeded starter fleet is already running.

### Managing the Droplet

Over SSH or in the Droplet Console:

```bash
cd /opt/trinity

docker compose -f docker-compose.hosted.yml ps          # status
./scripts/deploy/stop.sh                                # stop (never `down`)
./scripts/deploy/start.sh --hosted                      # start
docker compose -f docker-compose.hosted.yml restart     # restart
docker compose -f docker-compose.hosted.yml logs -f backend
```

**Updating.** Pin the release you want in `.env`, check out the matching tag so the compose files and mounted config move with the images, and re-run the installer:

```bash
cd /opt/trinity
echo 'TRINITY_IMAGE_TAG=v0.9.1' >> .env
sudo git fetch --tags && sudo git checkout v0.9.1
sudo ./scripts/deploy/start.sh --hosted
```

**Backups.** Nightly and pre-migration database backups land in `/opt/trinity/trinity-data/backups/` (the data directory is `./trinity-data` relative to the checkout). They are on the same disk as the database, so they protect against corruption and mistakes, not against losing the Droplet — take Droplet snapshots as well. See [Backup and Restore](backup-and-restore.md).

**Support.** GitHub Issues on `abilityai/trinity`, label `do-marketplace`. DigitalOcean does not build or support Trinity.

## DigitalOcean installer script

`scripts/deploy/trinity-do-create.sh` gives you the 1-Click result from your own terminal, with the admin password chosen before the Droplet exists — so there is no claim window. It needs [`doctl`](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/) installed and signed in (`doctl auth init` with a write-scoped API token). The step-by-step walkthrough — from installing `doctl` to adding a domain, with the installer's error messages and how to remove the Droplet — is [Deploy on DigitalOcean](digitalocean.md).

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abilityai/trinity/<release-tag>/scripts/deploy/trinity-do-create.sh)
```

It asks four questions and writes nothing to your computer:

1. **Admin password** (twice; 12+ characters, guessable prefixes refused). Your username will be `admin`.
2. **Claude subscription token** — run `claude setup-token` in another terminal and paste the `sk-ant-oat01-…` value. An API key is not accepted here; add one later under **Settings → Integrations** if you prefer.
3. **Region** and **Droplet name** (defaults offered), then a confirmation that names the monthly cost.

It then creates an Ubuntu 24.04 Droplet (4 vCPU / 8 GB — Trinity's recommended size), attaches every SSH key already on your account, and hands the Droplet a first-boot script that clones the pinned release to `/opt/trinity`, runs `start.sh --provision --cloud digitalocean --hosted --unattended` (Docker, Caddy with the IP certificate, the firewall, then the install itself), registers your Claude subscription and assigns it to the seeded agents. Both secrets travel only in the Droplet's own user-data; the firewall blocks containers from reading it back. The script polls `https://<ip>/` with certificate verification for up to fifteen minutes and prints the address when it answers. If it times out, open the Droplet's Console and read `/var/log/trinity-install.log`.

The install records `do-script` as its provenance, so the first-run **Secure this instance** step appears exactly as on the 1-Click. Day-two operations are identical — see [Managing the Droplet](#managing-the-droplet). The script pins the release it was fetched from; set `TRINITY_IMAGE_TAG` in the environment before running it to pick another.

## `.env` reference

Every key in `.env.example`, with the compose files that forward it. **A key a compose file does not forward does nothing on that install.** Legend: `dev` = `docker-compose.yml`, `prod` = `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `hosted` = `docker-compose.hosted.yml`. Keys marked "commented" ship commented out in `.env.example` and take effect only when you uncomment them.
