# Feature Flow: Prebuilt Images & Pull-Only Hosted Install (#2280)

> **Status**: 🟡 Partial (2026-08-24) — publish workflow, hosted compose, `start.sh --hosted`, TLS decision and docs landed; the cloud-init user-data example (AC4) lives in `trinity-ops-public` and is outstanding · **Issue**: #2280 (epic #2332) · **Requirements**: [infrastructure.md §8.9](../requirements/infrastructure.md)

## Overview

A fresh VM comes up serving Trinity in ~2 minutes with **no on-box builds**: five images are published to GHCR on every release tag, and `scripts/deploy/start.sh --hosted` pulls them instead of compiling.

**Why it exists.** `docker-compose.prod.yml` carried `build:` blocks and `start.sh` compiled `trinity-agent-base` on the host — Python + Node + Go + Claude Code, ~1.9 GB, 5–10 minutes. That fails the "one click" bar for every marketplace channel and is rejected outright by managed hosts and template catalogues (Elestio, Dokploy, Coolify, Hostinger Docker Manager), all of which accept pull-only compose files only. This is the gate the whole hosting arc sits behind: #2281 (DigitalOcean Marketplace), #2282 (Vultr), #2283 (Hostinger/Dokploy), #835 (Packer).

**Scope, stated honestly.** Pull-only means it does not **build** — it still needs the repository checked out beside it. The backend mounts four `./config/*` directories, Vector and the OTel collector mount their configs, and `/data` is a relative bind mount; handed to a catalogue without the repo, Docker creates every one of those as an empty directory and the install comes up with an empty template catalog and no first-run manifests, **with no error**. `docker-compose.hosted.yml`'s own header says so. Packaging the config into the images so the file can travel alone is a follow-up.

## User Story

As an operator provisioning a server (by hand, from a marketplace image, or from cloud-init), I run one command and get a serving Trinity in about two minutes, pinned to a release I chose — without a toolchain, a build cache, or a five-minute wait on the machine least able to absorb one.

## Entry Points

| Trigger | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `git push` of a `v*` tag | `.github/workflows/publish-images.yml` | Publishes all five images at `v0.9.0` / `0.9.0` / `0.9` / `latest` / `sha-<short>` for one digest |
| `workflow_dispatch` (optional `ref:`) | same workflow | **Smoke build only** — publishes `sha-<short>` and nothing else (see *Tag gating* below) |
| `./scripts/deploy/start.sh --hosted` | `scripts/deploy/start.sh` | Or `TRINITY_HOSTED=1`. Same script as the source install; only the image source differs |
| `./scripts/deploy/stop.sh` | `scripts/deploy/stop.sh` | Reads the running stack's own compose label to pick the right `-f`, then `stop` (never `down`) |
| `start.sh --provision --cloud digitalocean` | `scripts/deploy/start.sh:392-414` | Brings a **bare** cloud VM to the state `--hosted` assumes (#2380). Called by the Packer bakery, the 1-Click first boot, and the installer below — see *Provision Layer* |
| `bash trinity-do-create.sh` (on the operator's machine) | `scripts/deploy/trinity-do-create.sh` | Prompting installer: creates a DigitalOcean droplet whose user-data runs `start.sh --provision … --hosted --unattended` |

## Publish Layer — `.github/workflows/publish-images.yml`

Five matrix jobs, one per Trinity-built image: `trinity-backend`, `trinity-frontend`, `trinity-scheduler`, `trinity-mcp-server`, `trinity-agent-base`.

| Property | Contract |
|---|---|
| **OSS-only by construction** | `checkout` sets `submodules: false`, so `src/backend/enterprise` is empty in the build context. A structural property of the workflow, not a `.dockerignore` rule someone can edit; `build-without-submodule.yml` already proves the OSS tree builds standalone |
| **Provenance from the checked-out tree** | `VERSION`, `git rev-parse HEAD`, subject, timestamp and `inputs.ref \|\| github.ref_name` — never `github.sha`/`GITHUB_REF_NAME`, which describe the ref the workflow was *dispatched from*. A dispatch of `ref: v0.9.0` from `dev` would otherwise stamp `GIT_BRANCH=dev` into `GET /api/version` on the exact path meant for out-of-band builds |
| **Build args are per image** | Only `docker/backend/Dockerfile` declares the six provenance ARGs; `trinity-agent-base` takes `VERSION` alone (mirroring `build-base-image.sh`, its only other producer); scheduler and mcp-server declare none. The frontend takes **none** — every `VITE_*` is inlined into the world-readable bundle at build time, so a published image may carry only values correct for *every* install |
| **Injection-safe** | Every interpolated value arrives through `env:`, never inside a `run:` body. The commit subject is attacker-chosen text on a runner holding a `packages:write` token |
| **Actions SHA-pinned** | As everywhere else in this repo. A mutable tag on an action that holds a registry-write token is a supply-chain hole |
| **amd64 only (v1)** | DO Droplets and Vultr Cloud Compute both default to amd64. Cross-building the ~1.9 GB agent base under QEMU is slow and flaky; arm64 is gated on Hetzner CAX / Umbrel actually needing it |

### Tag gating (the `push`-only rule)

`flavor: latest=false` is load-bearing, not decoration: `docker/metadata-action`'s default is `latest=auto`, which applies `latest` on **any** semver tag ref on its own — so gating only the explicit `type=raw,value=latest` line would have been inert and the comment above it would have described a rule the workflow did not enforce.

Every mutable/version tag is then gated on `github.event_name == 'push'`. `github.ref` alone answers *"is this a tag ref"*, not *"is this a release"*: a `workflow_dispatch` started from a tag — the natural way to smoke-test this workflow — carries `refs/tags/v0.9.0` too. Dispatching an **old** tag rebuilds at a new digest (the agent base bakes `Claude Code (latest)`, so the content genuinely differs), republishes `0.9.0`/`v0.9.0`/`0.9` over a supposedly immutable version, and walks `latest` **backwards** — silently downgrading every unpinned hosted install on its next `start.sh --hosted`. A dispatch therefore publishes `sha-<short>` and nothing else, which is exactly what a smoke build needs; re-cutting a release is done by re-pushing the git tag, which fires `push` and takes the full set.

Both `0.9.0` **and** `v0.9.0` are published for one digest: `{{version}}` strips the leading `v`, so a release cut as git tag `v0.9.0` published only `0.9.0` while every doc, the compose header and `start.sh`'s own pin warning told operators to set `TRINITY_IMAGE_TAG=v0.9.0` — a pull that fails `manifest unknown`, which `start.sh` treats as fatal with a message blaming the operator's spelling.

`type=sha` is **not** used; the sha tag is a raw value from the actual HEAD, for the same dispatch reason as provenance.

### Verify anonymous pull

A container package first created by `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not reliably public. If any of the five lands private, `docker pull` on a fresh VM fails with `denied` — and `start.sh` has no way to tell that apart from a network fault, so it reports it to an operator who can do nothing about it. The last step therefore proves the operator's exact path where it is cheap: an **anonymous** `docker manifest inspect` with a scratch `DOCKER_CONFIG`, so the runner's own `ghcr.io` login cannot mask a private package. It runs after the push and fails the job on purpose — the image is already published; a red step is the one-time signal to flip visibility to Public.

**The reference is lowercased in the shell body.** This owner is literally `Abilityai` and a GHCR repository name must be lowercase: docker rejects the mixed-case reference *locally*, before any network call (`repository name must be lowercase`), so the retry loop would burn out and the step would fail on **every** publish — reporting a perfectly public package as private and destroying the one signal it exists to give. The push itself is unaffected (`docker/metadata-action` lowercases its `images:` input, and the `start.sh` default `ghcr.io/abilityai` is already lowercase); a hand-written reference has to do it itself.

## Compose Layer — `docker-compose.hosted.yml`

`docker-compose.prod.yml` with every `build:` block replaced by a GHCR `image:` and **nothing else changed** — same `.env` contract, ports, volumes, networks and security posture. Image selection is `${TRINITY_IMAGE_REGISTRY:-ghcr.io/abilityai}/<image>:${TRINITY_IMAGE_TAG:-latest}`, so an operator pins a release — or points at a fork's own Docker Hub builds (HOST-022) — without editing the file.

**The two files are CI-guarded, never trusted.** `tests/unit/test_2280_hosted_compose_parity.py` fails the build when hosted and prod disagree on the service set, any third-party image pin, the top-level volumes/networks, or **any** per-service value — the service comparison is **wholesale** (`prod` minus `{build, image}` vs `hosted` minus `{image}`), not a key allowlist. It began as an 18-key list that omitted `profiles`, `env_file`, `logging`, `labels`, `deploy` and `stop_grace_period`; `profiles` is live today on `cloudflared`, so a prod change that profile-gated or un-gated a service would have drifted silently past the guard whose entire purpose is catching that. An allowlist watches only the keys someone remembered, and the drift that matters is the key nobody thought of.

Two compose files describing one platform is exactly the shape of a bug this repo has shipped five times and named: `LOG_*` (#1039), the VoIP master switch (#1056), `AGENT_AUTH_SECRET` (#1707), the container log caps (#1871), and `ADMIN_USERNAME` (#2381). The guard compares the **raw** YAML, not `docker compose config` output — the raw form still holds the unexpanded `${VAR:-default}` strings, so a changed default is a diff, where the resolved form would silently agree whenever the local `.env` happens to match.

## Install Layer — `scripts/deploy/start.sh --hosted`

One script, two image sources. Secret generation, the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` contract (#2381), `DOCKER_GID` detection, the serving health poll and the next-steps card are shared; a parallel installer would be the parity bug class one layer up.

```
--hosted / TRINITY_HOSTED=1
  ├─ COMPOSE_FILES=(-f docker-compose.hosted.yml)      # explicit -f ⇒ NO auto-merge
  ├─ pre-flight (docker daemon, compose v2, FRONTEND_PORT probe)
  ├─ .env bootstrap + secret generation + ensure_docker_gid
  ├─ resolve_image_tag()      shell/CI > .env > latest
  ├─ TUNNEL_TOKEN set → COMPOSE_FILES+=(--profile tunnel) + persist COMPOSE_PROFILES to .env
  ├─ data-switch guard (BOTH directions — refuse; both-stores-present — warn, naming the one in use, #2528)
  ├─ docker pull $TRINITY_IMAGE_REGISTRY/trinity-agent-base:$TAG   (default ghcr.io/abilityai)
  │     └─ docker tag … trinity-agent-base:latest       # fatal on failure, never falls back to building
  ├─ Docker-Desktop log-source override appended BY NAME (auto-merge is off)
  ├─ docker compose -f … pull      # tailored fatal naming the three likely causes
  ├─ docker compose -f … up -d
  └─ serving health poll → hosted-specific next-steps card (+ pin warning on `latest`)
```

### The parts that are not obvious

| Concern | Resolution |
|---|---|
| **The agent base image is not a compose service** | The backend creates agent containers from the literal local tag `trinity-agent-base:latest` (hardcoded in `services/agent_service/lifecycle.py`, allowlisted as `trinity-agent-base:*` by SEC-172), and compose cannot retag. So hosted mode pulls the GHCR copy and `docker tag`s it locally. Retagging rather than repointing keeps SEC-172 and the #1809/#1816 image-drift check untouched — both read the container's own `Config.Image`, which stays `trinity-agent-base:latest` either way. **A bare `docker compose -f docker-compose.hosted.yml up -d` starts a platform that cannot create a single agent**, and it surfaces later as a missing-image error at agent-create time. Hence: the upgrade instruction is "re-run `start.sh --hosted`", never "pull" |
| **The pin is read from `.env`** | Precedence is shell/CI → `.env` → `latest`. `.env` is the only place an `--unattended` or marketplace install can persist config, and exporting an unconditional default instead — as this first shipped — silently beat the operator's own line, because compose gives the shell environment precedence over `.env`. The summary then reported `Currently pinned to: latest` as though they had chosen it |
| **A failed pull is fatal** | Falling back to a local build would reintroduce the 5–10 minute first boot the mode exists to avoid, on the install least able to absorb it. Both pull failures carry a tailored message naming the likely causes (tag not published, GHCR package still private, no route to ghcr.io) |
| **Auto-merge is off, so side effects are named** | The Docker-Desktop Vector log-source fix (#1432) is appended **by name**. Forcing it off under `--hosted` (as this first shipped) meant a hosted install on any VM-backed runtime shipped the very `docker_logs` source #1432 exists to avoid, and Vector busy-loops and pegs the Docker VM. The `vector` service is byte-identical between the files, so the override merges cleanly onto either |
| **The tunnel actually starts** | `cloudflared` is profile-gated, so a non-empty `TUNNEL_TOKEN` alone starts nothing. `--hosted` reads the token and appends `--profile tunnel`, then **persists** `COMPOSE_PROFILES` to `.env` — compose acts only on services in the active profile set, so without it every command the summary prints (`stop`, `logs -f`) silently excludes the tunnel container and leaves the instance publicly reachable after the operator has been told the stack is down |
| **`FRONTEND_PORT` is honoured in prod too** | It was hardcoded `"80:8080"` in prod, while `start.sh` offers `FRONTEND_PORT` as the remedy for a port conflict and prints the resulting URL. Fixed in both files rather than only in hosted — diverging them would defeat the parity guard |

### Data-switch guard (both directions)

Dev and hosted share a compose project name but **not** a `/data` source: `docker-compose.yml` mounts the named volume `trinity-data`, hosted binds `${TRINITY_DATA_PATH:-./trinity-data}`. So `--hosted` in a checkout that has been running the dev stack would come up on an **empty** database and migrate from zero while the real one sat untouched in the volume — with Redis, a named volume both files share, **not** reset, i.e. a half-migrated install carrying live session and lock state pointing at rows that no longer exist.

Both crossings are refused with the copy command, not warned about: the failure is silent, and by the time it is noticed the fresh DB may already have been written to. `TRINITY_DATA_PATH` is the documented escape for a deliberate fresh start.

**The reverse refusal names prod, not only hosted, and a third state warns (#2528).** The bind mount is what both `docker-compose.prod.yml` and `docker-compose.hosted.yml` write, so a source-built production host reaches the same state — the restart that filed #2528 was a source-built production host, via `quickstart.sh`'s bare `docker compose up -d` (that script is now an alias for `start.sh` and inherits the guard). The message used to assert "installed with `--hosted`" and offer only `--hosted` as the remedy, which on a prod box would have pulled GHCR images onto a host that builds its own; it now prints each install's own invocation and the never-stack rule (`docker-compose.prod.yml` is standalone — `-f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml` does not validate). When **both** stores exist — the real DB in the bind mount and a freshly seeded one in the named volume, which is exactly what a wrong-file start leaves behind — neither refusal fires, and a repeat of the same mistake was silent. That state gets a **warning**, not a refusal: the copy-across remedy leaves both in place, so refusing would block the operator who followed it. The warning names the store the stack will use and the one it will ignore. Guard executed under `bash` with a `docker` shim in `tests/unit/test_2528_compose_file_sets.py`; the supported compose file sets themselves are rendered in CI (`container-security.yml` → `verify-compose-file-sets`) and tabulated in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

The project name is derived by **compose's own rule** (`compose_project_name()`: lowercase → keep `[a-z0-9_-]` → trim leading `_`/`-`, `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` winning, shell over `.env`). The two disagreeing derivations it replaces stripped `_` and `-`, which compose keeps — so in a checkout named `project_trinity`, `trinity-dev`, or a worktree like `trinity-2280`, the derived name matched no real volume and this guard failed **open** on exactly the directory names most likely to be in use.

## Provision Layer — `start.sh --provision` (#2380)

`--hosted` assumes a machine that already has Docker. `--provision` gets a **bare** cloud VM there, and it is the only implementation of that: the Packer bakery, the 1-Click first boot and a hand-written doc script used to carry three copies, which had already drifted (the image's DROP list was missing 8081, so the login page answered plain HTTP past the certificate — #2281 review C1). The `packer/` copies are deleted; every caller enters here. Requirements: PROV-012…015.

```
start.sh --provision --cloud digitalocean [--machine-only | --site-only] [--provenance X]
  ├─ guard: Linux + root + the cloud's metadata service answers         (start.sh:392-404)
  ├─ machine phase — provision_machine (:188)       IP-independent, safe to bake
  │    Docker · Caddy 2.11.4 (floor 2.11.3 asserted) · ufw 22/80/443
  │    · trinity-docker-firewall.service → scripts/deploy/docker-firewall.sh
  ├─ site phase — provision_site (:271)             once per instance
  │    public IP from 169.254.169.254 → /etc/trinity/public-ip
  │    .env: FRONTEND_PORT=8081 · FRONTEND_URL=https://<ip> · TRINITY_INSTALL_SOURCE · [TRINITY_IMAGE_TAG]
  │    Caddyfile (:325-362) → restart caddy → poll https://<ip>/ verified → /etc/trinity/tls-status
  └─ --machine-only exits here; otherwise the normal install continues (with --hosted, the layer above)
```

| Caller | Invocation |
|---|---|
| Packer bakery (`packer/digitalocean/scripts/01-provision.sh:67`) | `--machine-only` — packages and the firewall unit go into the snapshot; Trinity is not installed |
| 1-Click first boot (`packer/digitalocean/files/opt/trinity-firstboot/firstboot.sh:114`) | `--site-only --provenance do-marketplace --hosted --unattended` — the machine phase is already baked, so no `apt-get update` per droplet |
| Installer user-data (`scripts/deploy/trinity-do-create.sh:189`) | `--hosted --unattended`, both phases, default provenance `do-script` |

| Concern | Resolution |
|---|---|
| **Inert on a laptop** | Off by default. It installs packages, resets ufw and claims :80/:443, so it refuses unless root, Linux and a reachable metadata service, which no laptop satisfies. `--cloud` accepts only `digitalocean`; the metadata URL is the one per-cloud difference |
| **Caddy is pinned, with a floor** | 2.11.4, and the installed version is asserted ≥ 2.11.3: earlier Caddy cannot issue a Let's Encrypt IP certificate (caddyserver/caddy#7399), and the no-domain HTTPS story rests on one. Not `apt-mark hold`, which would block security updates |
| **Certificate verified, never fatal** | The site phase polls `https://<ip>/` with normal verification for ~150 s. Trinity is not up yet, so Caddy answers 502 — a zero curl exit means the chain validated. A failure is recorded and warned, and the install continues |
| **One `.env` writer** | `scripts/deploy/env-file.sh::set_env_key` rewrites the line rather than `sed`-substituting a user-controlled value, where `&`, `\` and the delimiter corrupt it silently. `start.sh` also writes an `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the environment into `.env` when `.env` has none — the installer's user-data relies on this |
| **`X-DO-MARKETPLACE` follows provenance** | DigitalOcean's 1-Click header is emitted only for `do-marketplace`, not for every DigitalOcean install — the doc install did not come from the catalog |

### Host firewall — no port list (`scripts/deploy/docker-firewall.sh`)

Docker's published-port rules are evaluated ahead of ufw's chain, so `ufw deny 8000` on a host publishing `8000:8000` does nothing. The fix lives in `DOCKER-USER`, the one chain Docker leaves to the operator. It used to be a `DROP_PORTS` list kept in step with compose by a test — the hand-maintained-list shape this repo has shipped wrong before (#1039, #1056, #1707, #1871), and it shipped wrong here. Now it is inverted, in its own `TRINITY-FW` chain, in load-bearing order:

| # | Rule | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `RELATED,ESTABLISHED` → RETURN | replies to connections a container opened; without it agents lose outbound internet |
| 2 | `-d 169.254.0.0/16` → DROP | containers cannot read the cloud metadata service (below) |
| 3 | `-i docker0` / `-i br+` → RETURN | container→internet and container→container |
| 4 | everything else → DROP | nothing Docker publishes is reachable from off-box, whatever the port |

Users reach Caddy on 80/443 — host ports, which never traverse this chain (Caddy proxies `127.0.0.1:8081`). Naming what is inside rather than the public interface also closes a private VPC interface. The chain is rebuilt only when its final DROP is missing and the jump is inserted only once the chain is populated, so no run leaves an empty chain live; the systemd unit reapplies it on every boot (it replaces `iptables-persistent`, which ufw `Breaks:`). IPv4 only: Docker maintains an IPv6 `DOCKER-USER` only with daemon IPv6 enabled, which no Trinity compose file sets.

**The metadata block.** DigitalOcean serves a droplet's user-data verbatim from `169.254.169.254` for the life of the machine, and the installer's user-data carries the admin password and the Claude subscription token. An agent container is precisely the untrusted-code case, so the whole RFC 3927 range is dropped, and the rule must sit **ahead of** the bridge RETURNs or container traffic leaves the chain before reaching it. `tests/unit/test_2380_provision_single_source.py` pins the ordering.

### The installer — `scripts/deploy/trinity-do-create.sh`

Runs on the **operator's** machine, fetched from a release tag, and ends with an HTTPS address.

```
checks (before any prompt): doctl installed + signed in; a snap doctl needs $HOME
prompts: admin password (×2, ≥12 chars, guessable prefixes refused) · Claude token (sk-ant-oat01-…)
         · region · name · confirm the monthly cost
user-data (umask 077 temp file, removed on exit):
    clone the pinned tag → /opt/trinity
    start.sh --provision --cloud digitalocean --hosted --unattended
    register the Claude subscription, assign it to every agent the install created
doctl compute droplet create (ubuntu-24-04-x64, s-4vcpu-8gb, the account's SSH keys) --wait
poll https://<ip>/ with verification for 15 min → print the address, or the console fallback
```

| Concern | Resolution |
|---|---|
| **Prompts, not a file to edit** | A guide that says "change four lines" fails its audience and leaves two secrets on disk. `read -rs` keeps them off the terminal, out of shell history, and out of every file but the droplet's user-data |
| **Portability (#2683)** | A full `mktemp` template (GNU rejects `-t NAME`). A snap `doctl` has a private `/tmp`, so the file goes under `$HOME` (non-hidden: snap's `home` interface denies dotfiles), and an unset `$HOME` is refused before the first prompt. Every value in the user-data — both secrets and the tag — is `'\''`-quoted, because a `'` in a valid password broke first boot after the droplet was already billing. An empty SSH-key array under `set -u` on macOS's bash 3.2 |
| **A shell to support it** | Every SSH key already on the account is attached; without one, DigitalOcean emails a root password and the browser console is the only way in |
| **Release pin** | The default tag is tied to `VERSION` by `tests/unit/test_2380_installer_release_pin.py`, so a release cut cannot ship an installer that installs the previous RC |
| **Provenance** | `do-script` — guide-eligible, not a marketplace install ([install-provenance.md](install-provenance.md)) |

### A domain is a Settings field

The provisioned Caddyfile has two HTTPS sites: the bare IP on the `shortlived` profile, and a catch-all with `tls { on_demand }` gated by `ask http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/public/tls-allowed`. So Caddy obtains a certificate for the saved Public URL's host on its first request and refuses every other name; the operator never needs a root shell on the host. The gate's contract — exact parsed host, unauthenticated, fails closed — lives in [install-provenance.md](install-provenance.md) → *The step*.

## Stop Layer — `scripts/deploy/stop.sh`

Hosted mode passes an explicit `-f`, which disables compose's default file merge — so a bare `docker compose` in the checkout loads the **dev** file instead. Same project name, so it acts on the same containers, but it knows nothing about `cloudflared`, which the dev file does not define: the tunnel keeps running and the instance stays publicly reachable after the script prints "All services stopped". That is the same hazard `persist_compose_profile` closes, re-entering through the one entry point that change did not touch.

So `stop.sh` reads the running stack's own `com.docker.compose.project.config_files` label — compose's record of the files that created the project, which cannot drift the way a marker file or a heuristic can — and adds `-f docker-compose.hosted.yml` when it names the hosted file. Missing container or missing label (nothing running, or a pre-#2280 stack) degrades to the dev default, which is what the script always did.

It also runs `stop`, not `down`. `down` removes the platform containers and tears down `trinity-agent-network`, which every agent container is attached to — and it is the command `start.sh`'s own closing summary tells operators **not** to run, in both branches. A script named `stop.sh` running the forbidden verb was a standing contradiction.

## TLS (decided and documented; automated only under `--provision`)

Trinity serves plain HTTP and terminates TLS **outside** the application; there is no HTTPS listener in any compose file, and no auto-certificate step outside `--provision`. Three supported postures, documented in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`:

1. **Tunnel** — Cloudflare Tunnel; `cloudflared` is already a service, set `TUNNEL_TOKEN`. The default for a public instance, nothing to renew.
2. **Private network** — Tailscale/WireGuard/VPC, what the managed fleet runs. HTTP over a WireGuard tunnel is encrypted transport and a finished posture, not a compromise.
3. **Operator-run reverse proxy** — Caddy/nginx + Let's Encrypt.

Plain HTTP on a public IPv4 with none of the three is the one combination called out as unsafe. A provisioned DigitalOcean droplet — the 1-Click image (#2281) or the installer, both through `--provision` — is the deliberate exception: it comes up on a bare public IP with no domain, so provisioning installs a host Caddy with a Let's Encrypt short-lived IP certificate plus on-demand TLS for the domain an admin saves later, and Trinity shows a provenance-gated first-run hardening guide (#2380).

## Upgrade Path

```bash
echo 'TRINITY_IMAGE_TAG=v0.9.1' >> .env      # .env, not the shell — survives a reboot
./scripts/deploy/start.sh --hosted            # re-pulls platform images AND the agent base
```

A plain `docker compose -f docker-compose.hosted.yml pull` skips the base image (not a compose service) and leaves agents on the old runtime. Riding `latest` makes every re-run an unscheduled upgrade, which the summary warns about explicitly.

## Testing

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `tests/unit/test_2280_hosted_compose_parity.py` | Wholesale prod↔hosted service parity, third-party pin equality, top-level volumes/networks, the 8 GB floor in the header, `FRONTEND_PORT` in both files |
| `tests/unit/test_2280_publish_workflow_and_stop.py` | The verify step never passes a mixed-case owner as an image reference and lowercases the one it builds; `flavor: latest=false`; every non-sha tag gated on `github.event_name == 'push'` and the sha tag on nothing; `stop.sh` never runs `compose down` and selects its file from the compose label |
| `tests/unit/test_2390_start_sh_env_and_project_name.py` | `env_value()` dotenv parity with compose (quotes, inline comments, last-wins) and `compose_project_name()` against compose's real derivation, including the `_`/`-`-bearing directory names that made the data guard fail open |
| `tests/unit/test_2380_provision_single_source.py` | The Packer tree calls `start.sh --provision` for both phases and re-implements nothing (no packages, no Caddyfile); the firewall has no port list, RETURNs `ESTABLISHED` before it drops, and drops link-local ahead of the bridge RETURNs; ufw and `iptables-persistent` never both installed; the unit reapplies on boot; `--provision` refuses a workstation; the Caddyfile's `ask` gate and the endpoint's exact-host, fail-closed match |
| `tests/unit/test_2380_installer_portability.py` | Full `mktemp` template; snap `doctl` gets the file under `$HOME` and a missing `$HOME` is refused before any question; every single-quoted user-data interpolation is quoted, executed round-trip through a shell; the installer run against a stub `doctl` with no SSH keys |
| `tests/unit/test_2380_installer_release_pin.py` | The installer's default tag matches `VERSION` and is `v`-prefixed |
| `tests/unit/test_2528_compose_file_sets.py` | `quickstart.sh` is an alias for `start.sh` (static + argv passthrough); the data-switch guard executed under `bash` with a `docker` shim — reverse refusal names prod, both-stores-present warns naming the store in use, clean states silent; both standalone compose headers state they are not overlays; every supported file set renders locally (skips without a Compose CLI) and is listed verbatim in `container-security.yml` → `verify-compose-file-sets` |

## Outstanding

- **AC4** — the cloud-init user-data example (`trinity-ops-public/provision/cloud-init.sh`) taking admin password / domain / optional Cloudflare Tunnel token. Cross-repo, so it does not land here; #2280 stays open until it does.

## Explicit non-goals (flagged, not filed)

arm64/multi-arch publishing; image signing/attestation; making the agent base image reference configurable (rejected — it would require widening the SEC-172 allowlist, and retagging achieves the same result with no security surface); packaging the mounted `./config/*` into the images so `docker-compose.hosted.yml` can travel without the repo.
