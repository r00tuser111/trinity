- **Schema**: `runtime: {type: claude-code|gemini-cli, model: string}`

---

## 29. Voice Chat (VOICE-001)

### 29.1 Voice Session Initialization (VOICE-001)
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Description**: Real-time voice conversations with agents via Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio
- **Key Features**: `POST /api/agents/{name}/voice/start` loads voice prompt + summarizes prior chat, opens Gemini Live API WebSocket connection
- **Architecture**: Browser (mic) → WebSocket → Backend (proxy) → Gemini Live API → Backend → WebSocket → Browser (speaker)
- **Scope**: this is the **OSS start route**. The Workspace — the only front door since #2559 — starts through `client_portal/voice.py` (VOICE-010) under the portal principal. The bridge, the frames and `/ws/voice/{id}` are shared; only the start request differs. The OSS route is retained and unchanged, and has no first-party frontend caller after #2559.

### 29.2 Audio Streaming Bridge (VOICE-002)
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Description**: WebSocket proxy: browser ↔ backend ↔ Gemini, <100ms added latency
- **Key Features**: PCM 16kHz mono input, 24kHz mono output, base64 frame encoding

### 29.3 Transcript Persistence (VOICE-003)
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented · **no first-party caller since #2559**
- **Description**: Voice transcripts saved as ChatMessage rows with `source="voice"`, inline in existing chat sessions
- **Key Features**: Automatic transcript extraction from Gemini, `source` column on chat_messages table
- **Scope (#2559)**: the write path (`routers/voice.py::_save_transcript`) is **retained and unchanged**, but the only caller that supplied an Agent Detail chat session id was the retired chat-panel overlay, so no new `chat_messages` rows land here. **Historic rows keep rendering** — the `source === 'voice'` badge in `ChatBubble.vue` is their reader. The Workspace transcript is a different table written **per turn** (`enterprise_portal_messages.source` + `voice_call_id`, VOICE-010), not a save-at-end.

### 29.4 Frontend Voice UI (VOICE-004)
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented · **the Agent Detail surface is a door since #2559**
- **Description**: The voice orb (`components/chat/VoiceOverlay.vue`, driven by `composables/useVoiceSession.js`) has exactly **one** consumer: the Workspace conversation (VOICE-010). Agent Detail offers a **door**, not a surface — a **Talk** button in `AgentHeader` that navigates to `/workspace?agent=<name>&voice=1`, where the call starts.
- **Key Features**: VoiceOverlay component, pulsing status indicators, live transcript display, mute toggle — all in the Workspace
- **Visibility (#2559)**: Talk renders **unconditionally**. It is not gated on the platform voice flag, on the agent's running state, or on a per-agent probe. Availability is the destination's to report: the Workspace says in words why a call cannot start (`portalVoiceMode.js::voiceEntryState`), which is ent#438's ruling — *a dead button is a worse answer than a page that says why* — applied consistently. The per-agent `GET /api/agents/{name}/voice/status` probe the panel used is no longer called.
- **Entry contract (#2559)**: `?voice=1` is a **one-shot intent armed in the app**, never by the URL alone — see VOICE-010 and `public-access.md` §48.3 FR-1.

### 29.5 Voice System Prompt (VOICE-005)
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Description**: Per-agent `voice_system_prompt` field for voice personality
- **Key Features**: Stored on agent_ownership table, fallback to auto-generated prompt from agent name

### 29.6 Context Summary (VOICE-006)
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Description**: On voice start, summarize prior messages and inject into Gemini system prompt
- **Key Features**: Last 20 messages truncated to ~750 tokens, injected as conversation context
- **Scope**: this is the **OSS start route**'s summary (`_build_context_summary`), with the same caller-less status as VOICE-001 since #2559. The Workspace builds its own context from the portal thread (`_format_history_context`, VOICE-010).

### 29.7 Tool Calls + Canvas Orb (VOICE-007)
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented (#581)
- **Description**: Gemini voice sessions can invoke Trinity's `run_task` tool to dispatch agent tasks mid-conversation; frontend canvas orb replaces the static overlay
- **Key Features**: `run_task` declared to Gemini Live; non-blocking `asyncio.create_task` dispatch; prompt-injection mitigation (`_TOOL_PROMPT_MAX = 2000` chars); `_pending_tool_tasks` dict with cancellation on session end; canvas orb in `VoiceOverlay.vue` with `isToolCalling` state (no CDN dependencies); platform audit log on every tool call
- **Architecture — TWO paths since ent#535, chosen by `_is_workspace_bound`** (both `portal_session_id` AND `client_email` set):
  - **Workspace call** → `_dispatch_task_in_chat` → `client_portal.service.portal_chat` → the resumable-turn engine → the thread's `cached_claude_session_id`. The turn runs **as the agent, in the thread the call is bound to**, so it has that agent's skills, files, memory and mid-work state, and the answer lands in the chat (and on the canvas if it drew). **Since ent#551 the dispatch is asynchronous** (below): the model is answered at once and the turn runs in the background. (ent#535's 20 s spoken budget, which itself replaced the 30 s `wait_for` that cancelled the turn, is superseded on this path.)
  - **No thread** (VoIP, the legacy Agent Detail session) → `_execute_tool` → `agent_client.task(prompt)` under a 30s `wait_for`. Unchanged, and still the right path where there is nothing to run a turn in — and the **documented synchronous fallback**: spoken filler before the call, a stated 30 s budget, never silence.
- **Background tasks (ent#551, Workspace path)** — a long task runs while the conversation continues:
  - **Dispatch returns immediately.** `run_task` answers the model at once with an *accepted* result carrying a per-call task id (`t1`, `t2`, …) and the other tasks still running; the model keeps the floor and the person can speak, interrupt, or start something else. No tool timeout bounds the task.
  - **The user is told, always.** The etiquette block (VOICE-011) asks for a spoken line naming what was started; if no assistant speech is heard within `_ACK_WINDOW_SECONDS` (4 s) of the dispatch (allowing a filler spoken just before the call), the platform sends a text nudge on the realtime channel (`_ACK_NUDGE`) so the model speaks — the acknowledgement is structural, not a hope.
  - **Completion re-enters the call.** When the turn lands, `_TASK_DONE_NOTICE` (or `_TASK_FAILED_NOTICE` with the reason) is injected as a platform notice via `send_realtime_input(text=…)` — the ent#534 cap-warning channel — at a **natural boundary**: the model is not mid-turn, both the person and the model's own speech have been quiet ≥ `_NOTICE_QUIET_SECONDS` (2.5 s), no other tool call is pending; held at most `_NOTICE_MAX_HOLD_SECONDS` (20 s). Every platform text opens "never read this aloud", and an assistant transcript row that echoes one is scrubbed (`_scrub_platform_notice`) — the platform's words are never recorded as the agent's.
  - **Once, not three times — structurally.** On the Workspace path `run_task` is declared `NON_BLOCKING` and the accepted result is returned `SILENT` (the Live API's async function-calling shape), so the acceptance is context, not a turn the model answers; a blocking call's result is a turn and produced a second announcement no matter the wording. Refusals and container-path results stay spoken. The acceptance text still asks for a line only if none was given (the fallback on an SDK without the enums). The spoken request is flushed to the thread before the task's rows are written, so the rows read in the order things happened.
  - **Short, and honest about the canvas.** The etiquette caps an acknowledgement at one short sentence and a report at one or two, and — on a session that can draw — forbids claiming anything is on the canvas that no canvas tool put there; the completion notice says the result is in the chat only and invites drawing it first. The notice names the task and its request so the model can say which ask it answers; the result rides in clipped to `_TASK_RESULT_MAX` chars (the full reply is in the chat).
  - **Bounded concurrency.** `MAX_BACKGROUND_TASKS_PER_CALL = 3`; at the cap the tool answers with a refusal naming the running tasks, which the model voices — never an invisible queue. Each task keeps its id so two results are never conflated; "is that done yet?" is answerable from the accepted results and notices already in the model's context — no new tool.
  - **The call ending loses nothing.** Background turns are strongly referenced (`_detached_turns`) and are **not** in `_pending_tool_tasks`, so `end_session` never cancels them; a task that lands after the call writes its rows into the thread as an ordinary turn. Both rows (the prompt and the reply) carry `voice_call_id` = the call's session id (`source` stays NULL — typed, not spoken), which is the attribution: they render as ordinary turns with an "asked during a voice call" caption, outside the collapsed spoken block, and the `#2694` delta logic (keyed on `source='voice'`) is untouched. The two `#2694` seams recognise the id: the live-call guard lets the call's own turn through (it had refused every `run_task` since `#2694` landed after ent#535), and the delta cursor skips a reply carrying it, so a task landing mid-call never hides the call's first half from the next typed turn. Only the voice dispatcher writes the id.
  - **No invented results.** The accepted result and the etiquette block both say the model holds no result yet and must not guess one — the first live run answered "there are sixty-four files" seconds before the real count arrived.
  - **The surface knows.** A `task` WebSocket frame (`{state: started|finished|failed, task_id, label, running}`) drives a persistent badge on the orb that says *what* is running (the task's one-line label; several tasks → the count then the labels), distinct from the amber per-call working badge; a finished task bumps `panelVersion` so the canvas column refetches in the same moment. While the call is on, the thread's read cursor is advanced on every spoken turn and task landing, so the sidebar never badges the conversation the person is in.

### 29.11 Spoken Etiquette for the Tool Cycle (VOICE-011, trinity-enterprise#576)
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented (2026-09-12)
- **Description**: The voice model is told, once, how to speak around tools for the **whole** cycle — announce, execute, report — so the person is told a thing once and never has the canvas read to them. Replaces the filler-only `_TOOL_ETIQUETTE_INSTRUCTION`.
- **One block, built from the manifest**: `spoken_etiquette_instruction(manifest, background=…)` in `services/gemini_voice.py` is appended in `_build_live_config` for every session with any tool (Workspace call, Agent Detail, VoIP — one place, both front doors, both dispatch paths). It mentions `run_task` only when the manifest has it and the canvas only when a panel tool is in the manifest (ent#535 AC 6 preserved); `background` (the session is workspace-bound) selects the async wording, the synchronous filler wording otherwise. An empty manifest yields no block.
- **Rules**: *announce a wait, not an action* (a filler before `run_task`; none for a canvas write — the drawing appearing is the acknowledgement); *say it once* (after a result, add what is new; never restate the announced intention; never read the canvas aloud — point and interpret); *one narration per sequence* (one announcement, one report; speak in between only when expectations change, once); *report a failure once, with its reason* (a refusal is reported, never dressed as success); *background tasks* (the id, the cap, the natural-pause report). `_RUN_TASK_TOOL`'s description carries a one-line summary that agrees with the block; `WORKSPACE_PANEL_INSTRUCTIONS` states the division of labour (canvas = the artefact, voice = what it means) beside the "don't mirror every voice response" rule.
- **Pinned**: `tests/unit/test_ent576_spoken_etiquette.py` asserts the block is in the session's `system_instruction` for workspace and non-workspace sessions alike, that the run_task description and the block agree, and caps the block's size (the instruction rides every session).
- **The tool surface is a locked manifest (ent#535)**: `services/voice_tools.py` resolves it ONCE at session start from the platform default narrowed by the agent's own `template.yaml` `voice: tools:`; `_build_live_config` builds from it and the dispatcher refuses any name outside it before reading an argument. A per-agent declaration may only **narrow** — the file is agent-writable, so one that could ADD would let an agent grant itself a capability by editing itself. Tri-state: `None` = never resolved → platform default; `frozenset()` = a decision → refuse everything. It is **persisted in the Redis session blob**, because production runs `--workers 2` and a rebuild that reads it as unresolved silently hands back the full default (the ent#535 review finding).
- **`include_owned` travels on the session** (`VoiceSession.is_platform`, default False), written by `start_workspace_voice`, which is the gate that refuses a non-platform caller. Re-asserting it as a constant at the turn site would widen `agent_on_roster` for any future path that binds a call without going through that gate.

### 29.8 Voice Workspace (VOICE-008)
- **Status**: ⛔ **Retired (#2484)** — the page and its route are gone; recorded here for the panel-tool contract it introduced, which VOICE-009/VOICE-010 inherited. `AgentHeader`'s button now opens THE Workspace (ent#438), and since #2559 a second button beside it opens it **with the call starting**.
- **Description**: Full-page workspace at `/agents/:name/workspace` with split layout — orb + controls left, agent-controlled canvas panel right; gated behind `voice_available` feature flag
- **Key Features**: 6 in-process panel tools (`show_markdown`, `show_diagram`, `show_image`, `update_panel`, `append_to_panel`, `clear_panel`); 300ms poll via `GET /voice/{session_id}/panel`; DOMPurify sanitization; 512 KB content cap; `workspace_mode` param on `voice/start`; BETA-badged button in AgentHeader

### 29.9 Voice Workspace Canvas Enrichment (VOICE-009)
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented (#979)
- **Description**: Enriches the VOICE-008 canvas with Mermaid diagrams, image display, client-side panel history, and orb/transition polish — endpoint contract unchanged
- **Key Features**:
  - `show_diagram(diagram, title?)` → `mermaid` panel type rendered strictly inside the existing opaque-origin `sandbox="allow-scripts"` iframe via a self-contained `mermaid.min.js` IIFE bundle (no runtime chunk fetches); agent diagram text injected as a JS string (`JSON.stringify` + `<`→`<`, no `</script>` breakout) with `securityLevel:'strict'`; invalid syntax renders a contained error + source, not a broken panel
  - `show_image(src, title?, caption?)` → `image` panel type; web URLs render directly via Vue `:src`, workspace file paths fetched through the authenticated `/files/preview` endpoint as a blob (a bare `<img src>` would 401). Path confinement enforced in-process by `_classify_image_src` (rejects `..`, absolute escapes, the `/home/developer-evil` sibling, `data:`, and non-http schemes — stricter than the agent-server prefix check)
  - Client-side panel history: ring buffer of the last 40 snapshots with prev/next + dropdown selector; "live" follows the latest, navigating back pins a snapshot until a new update arrives; frontend-only, no backend change; image blob objectURLs revoked on eviction + unmount
  - Orb polish: asymmetric attack/release smoothing on energy (0.18/0.10), smoothed core size, idle "breathe" floor, larger core (58) and glow swing (32×)
  - Graceful canvas-update cross-fade + header "updated" flash, honoring `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Security**: agent markup/diagrams render only inside the opaque-origin sandboxed iframe; images render via `:src` (no `v-html`); panel tools are backend+frontend only (not on the MCP surface — Invariant #13 N/A)

### Phase Roadmap
1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Authenticated chat only, basic overlay, transcript on session end, manual voice prompt ✅
2. **Phase 2 (Polish)**: Real-time waveform, incremental transcript, auto-generate voice prompt from CLAUDE.md ✅
3. **Phase 3 (Advanced)**: Tool calling (run_task), canvas orb ✅ — multi-language auto-detection, custom voice per agent (deferred)
4. **Phase 4 (Workspace)**: Full-page workspace with canvas panel tools, feature-flag gated (BETA) ✅ — page retired by #2484
5. **Phase 5 (One front door)**: the call lives in the Workspace conversation (VOICE-010, ent#534) ✅ — and since #2559 that is the **only** front door: Agent Detail offers a Talk door into it, not a second surface

---

### 29.10 Workspace Voice Mode (VOICE-010, trinity-enterprise#534)
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented (2026-09-07)
- **Description**: The real-time voice session started from — and written back into — a **Workspace thread**, as a modal call with the orb. Start: `POST /api/enterprise/client-portal/agents/{name}/voice/start` under the portal principal (platform users only; off-roster, a foreign thread and a portal token are one uniform 404; per-(user, agent) rate limit; 503 with a reason when voice is off). The session carries `portal_session_id` + `client_email`, `workspace_mode=True`, `canvas_audience="operator"`, `max_duration=WORKSPACE_VOICE_MAX_DURATION` (default **1800 s**, env, wired through compose). `/stop`, `/ws/voice/{id}` and `/panel` are the shared OSS routes.
- **Transcript**: written **turn by turn** by the worker holding the live socket (`client_portal/voice.py::persist_voice_turn`) as `enterprise_portal_messages` rows with `source='voice'` + `voice_call_id`; the call closes with one `system` row ("Voice call · N min", plus how it ended); a call with no turns writes nothing; `/stop` never writes for this surface; the OSS save-at-end path (VOICE-003, caller-less since #2559) is idempotent (in-process flag + Redis SETNX claim). Context for the call = the thread's recent turns (system rows skipped, earlier spoken rows labelled); `_format_history_context` labels spoken rows `(voice)` and budgets them under one total 24k-char budget across calls, trimmed oldest-first with every cut named (#2694 — replaced the 12-per-call counter; a whole 30-minute call fits); a resumed turn is prefixed with the spoken rows since the agent's last typed reply (`_format_voice_delta`).
- **Session lifetime**: every session requests context-window compression + session resumption; a `go_away` reconnects with the latest handle (≤ 8 per call) while the browser socket, watchdog and transcript span the call; the cap sends a spoken wrap-up notice at T-30 s (`send_realtime_input(text=…)`) and ends with `end_reason="cap"`; `status{ended, reason, message}` and a final `saved` frame tell the client why and when to reload. "This thread is on a call" is a property of that **connection** lifetime, not of the start: the thread's live-call marker (`portal_voice_active:{session}`, the gate behind the typed-turn 409) is a **lease held by the audio bridge** — armed at connect inside the same `try` whose `finally` releases it, renewed every 15 s on a 60 s TTL while that bridge lives, never renewed past the call's own cap, and released unconditionally and owner-matched on every exit (#2700; before it the start armed a cap-sized marker whose only closers lived downstream of a socket that might never open).
- **Capability**: `PortalRoster.realtime_voice {available, reason}` — platform principals only, fail-closed, provider-neutral name (ent#354); distinct from the per-agent TTS `voice_available`.
- **Canvas**: the call's right column reads `/panel` (refetch on panel `tool_result` frames + 3 s poll) through `CanvasPanel`; a platform principal reads every canvas audience in the Workspace (`agent_page.canvas_audience_for`), a portal-token client stays `roster`.
- **Front doors (#2559)**: the Call control in the Workspace conversation header, and the **Talk** door on Agent Detail (`AgentHeader` → `/workspace?agent=<name>&voice=1`). `?voice=1` is a **one-shot intent armed in the app**: `armVoiceAutoStart()` sets a module-scoped flag in `portalVoiceMode.js` before the push, and `voiceAutoStart()` honours the param only when it is armed **and** the agent landed **and** the principal is a platform user. A pasted, bookmarked or mailed link always arrives on a fresh document where the flag is false, so it never auto-starts a billed call — including the signed-out variant, where the sign-in click would otherwise satisfy any browser activation heuristic. `bootstrap()` strips the key on **every** exit, keyed on its presence.
- **Retired**: the ent#440 hands-free loop (`voiceConversation.js`) — one voice entry point; and, by #2559, the Agent Detail chat-panel overlay. See `public-access.md` §48.3.

## 39. VoIP Telephony (VOIP-001)

### 39.1 Outbound Phone Calls over Gemini Live (#1056 — Phase 1)
- **Status**: 🚧 In Progress
- **Implements**: Issue #1056 (Phase 1 — outbound)
- **Description**: An agent places an outbound phone call to a user and
  holds a real-time, interruptible voice conversation powered by the
  existing Gemini Live voice bridge. A phone call is just a **different
  transport feeding the same Gemini queues** — `services/gemini_voice.py`
  is **not modified**. Ships as a regular OSS feature (no entitlement
  gating), gated behind a feature flag that is **OFF by default**.
- **Feature flag (default OFF)**: `voip_available` is exposed by
  `GET /api/settings/feature-flags` as
  `VOIP_ENABLED and bool(GEMINI_API_KEY)`. `VOIP_ENABLED` defaults to
  `false`. All VoIP
  endpoints 404 when the flag is off. The feature is additionally
  per-agent-gated: it only functions once a `voip_bindings` row exists.
- **Transport**: Twilio Programmable Voice + bidirectional Media Streams
  (`<Connect><Stream>`), delivering raw G.711 μ-law 8kHz audio over a
  WebSocket directly into the existing Gemini queues. Explicitly **not**
  Twilio ConversationRelay (does its own STT/TTS for text LLMs) and
  **not** Pipecat/LiveKit (would re-implement the owned bridge).
- **Per-agent Twilio-voice credentials**: dedicated `voip_bindings`
  table (`account_sid`, AES-256-GCM-encrypted `auth_token`, `from_number`,
  `webhook_secret`, `enabled`, `daily_call_cap`), **separate from
  `whatsapp_bindings`** (voice and messaging are different Twilio
  products). Each agent owner brings their own Twilio account — outbound
  PSTN spend is on the owner's account, not the platform operator's.
- **Audio conversion** (stdlib `audioop`, all codec work in the adapter):
  inbound μ-law 8kHz → PCM16 16kHz (`ulaw2lin` → `ratecv(8k→16k)`);
  outbound PCM16 24kHz → μ-law 8kHz (`ratecv(24k→8k)` direct decimation
  → `lin2ulaw`), re-chunked to 160-byte/20ms frames, base64 for Twilio
  JSON. `audioop.ratecv` **state is carried per-direction per-connection**
  (no per-chunk reset → no boundary clicks). `audioop-lts` is pinned for
  Python ≥ 3.13 (stdlib `audioop` removed in 3.13).
- **Interruption**: relies on Gemini Live's native barge-in. The adapter
  flushes Twilio's buffer via a **`clear`** event + drops its local
  accumulator when the user speaks while the agent is mid-utterance, so
  buffered audio does not play over the caller.
- **Outbound trigger**:
  - `POST /api/agents/{name}/voip/call` (JWT/MCP, `AuthorizedAgent`) and
    the MCP tool `call_user`. Body: `{to_number, context?,
    process_transcript?}`.
  - The trigger creates a `chat_session` (owner identity), mints a
    single-use WSS ticket, stages session intent (agent, user, system
    prompt, chat_session_id, `process_transcript`) in Redis keyed by a
    high-entropy `call_id`, then calls Twilio
    `calls.create(to, from_, twiml="<Connect><Stream url='wss://…/api/voip/voice/{call_id}?ticket=…'/></Connect>")`.
  - **Abuse controls** (Phase 1): rate-limited per `(owner, destination)`
    via `services/rate_limiter.py`; a durable per-agent **daily call cap**
    (`voip_call_logs` count); optional `Idempotency-Key` (Invariant #18).
    A formal opt-in destination allowlist is deferred to Phase 2.
- **Cross-worker safety**: the trigger does **not** call
  `connect_and_stream`; it only stages intent in Redis. The WS handler —
  running on whichever worker Twilio's Media Streams socket actually hits —
  reads the staged intent, calls `voice_service.create_session(...)` then
  `connect_and_stream(...)`, so the live Gemini connection lives on the
  correct worker.
- **Two-id namespace**: `call_id` (chosen at trigger time; in the WSS URL
  + Redis intent key + ticket binding) is distinct from the Gemini
  `VoiceSession.session_id` (`vs_…`, minted at WS-connect inside the
  unmodified `create_session`). They are never conflated.
- **WSS auth**: the Media Streams socket (Twilio cannot send a JWT) is
  gated by a single-use, call-bound ticket via
  `services/ws_ticket_service.py`. `mint_ticket` gains an optional
  `ttl_seconds` param (VoIP mints at 180s to cover PSTN dial+ring, vs the
  30s browser default) and binds the ticket with `scope="voip:{call_id}"`,
  verified in the handler. Staged intent is consumed exactly once via
  Redis `GETDEL`.
- **Transcript persistence**: the call transcript is persisted to
  `chat_messages` with `source="voice"` via the existing `_save_transcript`
  path, guarded by a Redis SETNX sentinel so a double-teardown saves
  exactly once.
- **Post-call processing (default ON)**: after teardown, the full
  transcript is dispatched as a single turn to the **main agent** through
  `task_execution_service.execute_task(triggered_by="voip")` so the agent
  (with its real skills/memory/MCP) digests the call and takes follow-up
  actions. Per-call opt-out via `process_transcript=false`; skipped when
  the transcript is empty (no-answer / instant hangup); once-guarded.
- **Config**: `VOIP_ENABLED` (default `false`),
  `VOIP_MAX_CALL_DURATION` (default 600s — VoIP-specific, not the
  inherited 300s `VOICE_MAX_DURATION`), `VOIP_DEFAULT_DAILY_CALL_CAP`
  (default 50), `VOIP_TICKET_TTL_SECONDS` (default 180),
  `VOIP_CALL_RATE_LIMIT` / `VOIP_CALL_RATE_WINDOW`.
- **Three surfaces in sync (Invariant #13)**: backend router
  (`routers/voip.py`) + MCP tool (`src/mcp-server/src/tools/voip.ts`).
  No agent-server mirror (the bridge is backend-only).
- **Out of scope (Phase 1)**: inbound calls ("you call the agent" —
  Phase 2: Twilio voice webhook + `X-Twilio-Signature` + inbound
  number→agent resolution on the same table; an `inbound_number` column
  is shipped up-front so Phase 2 is additive); opt-in destination
  allowlist (Phase 2); schedule-action trigger and call cost/duration
  observability (Phase 3). Real PSTN path is manual-verify (needs a live
  Twilio voice number). (UI config surface delivered separately in §39.2.)

### 39.2 Per-agent VoIP config UI + persisted voice (trinity-enterprise#28)
- **Status**: 🚧 In Progress
- **Implements**: Issue trinity-enterprise#28 (the Phase-3 "UI config surface"
  deferred by #1056)
- **Description**: A per-agent VoIP config panel in the agent Settings/Sharing
  tab (`components/VoipChannelPanel.vue`) to create/update/remove the
  `voip_bindings` row over the existing OSS `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/agents/{name}/voip`
  endpoints (Twilio Account SID, write-only Auth Token, From number, optional
  daily call cap), an **enable/disable toggle**, and a **persisted voice picker**.
- **OSS, not entitlement-gated**: shipped as a plain OSS capability gated purely
  on the existing `voip_available` platform flag (the frontend reads it via
  `stores/sessions.js`). No enterprise entitlement, no `register_module`, no
  `trinity-enterprise` submodule change — a deliberate simplification over the
  issue's original "entitlement-gated" framing (a UI gate over an OSS,
  money-spending backend would be cosmetic; gate is the platform flag instead).
- **Enable/disable toggle**: `PUT /api/agents/{name}/voip/enabled`
  (`{enabled: bool}`, owner-only, 404 when no binding) flips `voip_bindings.enabled`
  without re-entering credentials; the call path already refuses disabled
  bindings. Re-saving credentials via the binding PUT **preserves** the current
  `enabled` state (the upsert no longer forces `enabled=1`).
- **Persisted per-agent voice**: new edition-agnostic OSS primitive
  `agent_ownership.voice_name` (default `Kore`, like `voice_system_prompt`) with
  `GET/PUT /api/agents/{name}/voice/name` (PUT owner-only, validated against the
  canonical `GEMINI_VOICE_NAMES`). Replaces the two hardcoded `"Kore"` sites
  (`routers/voice.py::_get_voice_name`, `services/voip_service.py`), so the chosen
  voice applies to **both** the in-app voice overlay/workspace and outbound VoIP
  calls. Resolution precedence at a voice start: per-session request override →
  persisted `voice_name` → `Kore`; the read path falls back to `Kore` for an
  unset or no-longer-valid persisted value. The Workspace ephemeral picker
  defaults to the persisted voice. Dual-track migration (SQLite `db/migrations.py`
  + Alembic `0004_agent_ownership_voice_name` + `db/schema.py`/`db/tables.py`).

## 40. Multi-Runtime Harnesses — OpenAI Codex (#1187)

### 40.1 Codex CLI Execution Engine (#1187 — MVP)

Trinity agents may run on the **OpenAI Codex CLI** as a third execution runtime
("harness == runtime") alongside Claude Code and Gemini. A template selects it
via `runtime: { type: codex, model: gpt-5.6-sol }`; the container is created
with `AGENT_RUNTIME=codex` and `codex_runtime.py` implements the `AgentRuntime`
ABC. Follow-up to spike #854.

**Functional requirements:**
- **FR-1 — Execution:** `/api/chat` and `/api/task` run via `codex exec --json`;
  the `-o/--output-last-message` file is the authoritative response (read-then-delete);
  JSONL `agent_message` is the fallback. Tokens/cost from `turn.completed.usage`
  (estimated cost — Codex has no native cost; `reasoning_output_tokens` is a subset
  of `output_tokens`, never double-counted).
- **FR-2 — Chat continuity:** `codex exec resume <thread_id>` continues the Chat-tab
  conversation. The Session tab's cached-UUID `--resume` model is NOT supported in
  the MVP (gated off for codex; chat continuity lives in the Chat tab).
- **FR-3 — Safety parity (blocking):** the platform system prompt reaches Codex
  (prepended per-turn; `CLAUDE.md`→`AGENTS.md` mirrored at startup for identity);
  read-only mode maps to `--sandbox read-only`; guardrails are honored where they
  map to Codex's control surface and surfaced (logged) where they don't; Codex
  output + logs pass through the credential sanitizer.
- **FR-4 — Sandbox + network:** normal (writable) agents run `--sandbox danger-full-access`,
  which DISABLES Codex's own bubblewrap sandbox — `workspace-write`/`read-only` both invoke
  `bwrap` to create a user namespace, which the hardened Trinity container forbids
  (`bwrap: No permissions to create a new namespace`), blocking every shell tool. The Trinity
  container is already the boundary (`cap_drop ALL` + AppArmor + `no-new-privileges`), the same
  posture Claude/Gemini run under, so dropping the redundant inner sandbox weakens nothing.
  Read-only agents keep `--sandbox read-only` (sandbox-native write protection) as the interim
  enforcement — a fail-closed read-only enforcement story for Codex is a fast-follow.
- **FR-5 — Credentials:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the agent's `.env` (CRED-002),
  loaded into the subprocess env **and materialised into `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`**
  before the first spawn (#2208 — the CLI authenticates its
  `wss://api.openai.com/v1/responses` transport from that file, not from the
  environment, and the transport is no longer toggleable, so the env var alone
  yields `401` on every turn). Written via `codex login --with-api-key` with the
  key on stdin, never argv. A subscription `auth.json` (#1971) wins and is never
  overwritten, nor is one that cannot be parsed; a stored key that no longer
  matches `.env` is refreshed, since #1999 rebuilds the execution env per spawn.
  Codex agents are NOT assigned a Claude subscription.
- **FR-6 — MCP:** Trinity HTTP MCP + template MCP servers wired via `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`;
  the bearer token is referenced by env var, never persisted as a literal.
- **FR-7 — Capabilities:** each runtime declares `RuntimeCapabilities`
  (`chat_continuity`, `session_tab_resume`, `mcp_support`, `cost_reporting`);
  `get_runtime()` validates `AGENT_RUNTIME` and fails loudly on unknown values.

**Non-functional:** concurrency-safe orphan cleanup (must not kill sibling
executions); `CODEX_HOME` relocated off the git-tracked workspace; error→HTTP
mapping keeps non-auth failures at 500 (never 503) so the dispatch breaker's
AUTH-only counting and the SUB-003 auth switch stay inert for Codex.

**Out of scope (fast-follow):** shared subprocess-helper DRY extraction; Session-tab
cached-UUID resume for Codex; backend reading `ExecutionMetadata.error_code`
directly; Codex SSE streaming; vision/images; a post-creation runtime-switch
endpoint. See the [Harness Authoring Guide](harness-authoring-guide.md) for adding
a fourth runtime.

## 41. Model-Conditional Prompt Tiers (ent#243)

### 41.1 Tier Resolution — the axis is the MODEL, not the runtime

Anthropic's Claude 5-generation context-engineering guidance (rules → judgment,
examples → interface design) applies to *frontier coding-post-trained models*,
and is **actively harmful** on smaller/older ones — Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5 need
the explicit structure it removes. Three vendors reached the same conclusion
independently (OpenAI on GPT-5-Codex over-prompting, Google on Gemini 3
over-analyzing verbose prompt engineering), so the fault line is model class, not
vendor and not harness.

This is why the tier is **not** keyed on `AGENT_RUNTIME`. MODEL-001 lets a
schedule, loop, or chat turn pin any model string — including free-text — so a
`claude-code` agent routinely runs Haiku 4.5. Gating on the runtime label would
silently degrade the majority of the selectable surface (7 of 9 `PRESET_MODELS`
entries sit in the tier where the guidance does not apply). Runtime already has
its own orthogonal job in this module: `_adapt_instructions_for_runtime` rewrites
MCP tool naming for Codex (#1187 F-MCP). The two axes stay separate.

**Functional requirements:**
- **FR-1 — Classifier:** `services/prompt_tier.py::resolve_prompt_tier(model)`
  returns `PromptTier.MINIMAL | PromptTier.VERBOSE`. Total function, never raises,
  pure-stdlib. Mirrors the `services/model_context.py` shape: family-prefix rules,
  first-match-wins, most-specific-first.
- **FR-2 — Unknown fails toward VERBOSE.** An unrecognized, empty, or `None` model
  resolves to `VERBOSE` — today's prompt. Over-instructing a Claude 5 model costs
  tokens; under-instructing a 4.5 model silently degrades it, and free-text model
  passthrough makes an unknown id routine rather than exceptional. This mirrors
  `model_context.py`'s "fail toward the conservative value" invariant and is the
  property that bounds this feature's blast radius to *status quo*.
- **FR-3 — Section-level gating, never two prompt strings.** `PLATFORM_INSTRUCTIONS`
  stays a single authored literal; sections are derived from it by splitting on
  its `###` headings and filtered by tier at render time. Maintaining two full
  prompts guarantees drift — a security instruction added to one variant and not
  the other is the failure mode this forbids by construction.
- **FR-4 — A section with no explicit tier renders always.** An unmapped or renamed
  heading falls back to always-render, and the heading set is CI-pinned so a rename
  fails loudly instead of silently changing what agents are told.
- **FR-5 — Safety and privacy sections are un-gateable.** Operator Communication
  (the #1402 fire-and-park contract, itself sentinel-locked and synced to
  `config/trinity-meta-prompt/prompt.md`) and the per-user memory-leak warning
  render at every tier. They are not tool-usage guidance and have no tool
  description to live in.

**Non-functional:**
- **Provable no-op on landing.** The MINIMAL prefix set ships **empty**, so every
  model resolves VERBOSE and the rendered prompt is byte-identical to the previous
  release. Enabling a family is a separate, evidence-gated change (ent#243 PR 2),
  which is what keeps a fleet-wide prompt change out of the same PR as its mechanism.
- **Prompt caching is unaffected.** The cache is keyed per model, so a cache entry
  is never shared across models; varying the prefix by model adds no fragmentation.
- Not vendored to the agent server (unlike `model_context.py`, Invariant #5): the
  backend composes the prompt and ships it in the turn payload, so the agent server
  never resolves a tier.

### 41.2 Model Availability at Compose Time

The prompt is composed **per turn** and is never baked into the container:
`get_platform_system_prompt()` is uncached and re-reads the operator's
`trinity_prompt` setting on every call, and the result travels in the request
payload. A model changed in the UI therefore takes effect on the next turn with no
container recreate, restart, or cache invalidation.

Composition paths and whether the model is known:

| Path | Model at compose time |
|---|---|
| `task_execution_service` (schedules, loops, webhooks, public/paid/channel via `execute_task`) | resolved to a concrete string before compose |
| `chat_execution_service` | `request.model`, **nullable** — no default-resolution step on this path |
| `pull_coordination_service` | **absent** — not passed into `ExecutionContext` at all (fixed here) |

- **FR-6 — The pull path threads its model.** `pull_coordination_service` populates
  `ExecutionContext.model`, so a pull-claimed turn is classified like any other.
- **FR-7 — An unpinned chat turn resolves VERBOSE, by design.** When the caller
  sends no model the *agent container* selects one (`claude_code.py` →
  `claude-sonnet-4-6`) **after** the prompt was composed — the decision does not
  exist backend-side at compose time and cannot be threaded. `claude-sonnet-4-6` is
  a 4.x model that wants the verbose prompt, so FR-2's default is already correct
  for this case. Resolving the platform default backend-side instead would trade a
  known-safe gap for a hidden one, since the backend default and the agent's
  `get_default_model()` can diverge silently. Making that second decision point
  explicit is a tracked follow-up, not a prerequisite (the same split underlies
  #1521's context-window "safe floor").

## 42. Custom Model Provider (LLM-PROVIDER-001)

Claude-runtime agents and the backend's own model calls can run against an
**Anthropic-compatible third-party provider** (e.g. DeepSeek's
`/anthropic` endpoint) instead of Anthropic. One provider is active per
instance; the choice is platform-wide.

- **FR-1 — Platform-wide mode.** Settings → Integrations carries a model
  provider with two modes: `anthropic` (default, today's behaviour, unchanged)
  and `custom`. Custom mode stores a base URL, an API key (encrypted at rest
  like every other credential setting), a model list (`id`, display label,
  context window) and a default + fast model drawn from that list. Admin-only;
  every change is audited; the key is never logged or returned unmasked.
- **FR-2 — Agent injection.** In custom mode, an agent that would otherwise
  receive the platform Anthropic key receives `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
  `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, the opus/sonnet/haiku alias
  mappings, `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL`, `TRINITY_PROVIDER_MODELS`,
  `TRINITY_PROVIDER_CONTEXT_WINDOWS` and
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1` — and **never**
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. A per-agent Claude subscription still wins (explicit
  per-agent choice). Non-Claude runtimes are untouched.
- **FR-3 — Fleet convergence.** Switching mode or editing the provider makes
  existing containers stale; the start path detects the drift and recreates
  them, and the settings surface can restart running agents to apply it now.
  Saving does not restart the fleet on its own — Apply is the only restart,
  and it waits until each agent is accepting health checks before reporting
  that agent as switched. A chat or task for a running Claude agent whose
  container env is not the active provider yet is refused before it reaches
  the agent, naming the provider switch, instead of being sent into a
  container that cannot authenticate.
- **FR-4 — No Anthropic credential leaves to a third party.** In the agent, a
  baseline `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` force-unsets any `.env` `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` at
  spawn. Any model id not in the provider list (stored Claude ids on schedules,
  public-channel overrides, the image's Claude default) is dropped from argv so
  the provider default applies instead.
- **FR-5 — Model selection follows the provider.** In custom mode the
  selectable catalog (operator picker, admin default, public-channel override,
  Workspace composer) is the provider's model list; the platform default model
  is the provider default; dispatch validation accepts provider ids by exact
  match (they reach argv). Context windows come from the provider list.
- **FR-6 — Backend model calls follow the provider.** Workspace title
  generation, compatibility AI checks and platform-prompt summarisation call
  the active provider's `/v1/messages`; the key test sends a one-token message
  in custom mode. The Claude subscription headroom probe stays Anthropic-only.
  A compatibility check against a custom provider disables thinking when it
  forces a tool, and if the provider still rejects that forced `tool_choice`
  the check retries once without it. Anthropic calls are unchanged.
- **FR-7 — URL safety.** The base URL must be `https://`, or `http://` to a
  loopback/private host (a local gateway such as LiteLLM). Link-local and
  cloud-metadata hosts are refused.
- **Out of scope.** Per-provider pricing (cost figures under a custom provider
  are Claude-priced and labelled approximate), multiple simultaneous providers,
  and built-in OpenAI-protocol translation (use an external gateway).
