# Five call sites were each hand-rolling `grep ... | cut -d'=' -f2- | tr -d
# '[:space:]'`, which is NOT how compose reads the same file. Compose strips
# surrounding quotes and a trailing ` # comment`, and it PRESERVES internal
# spaces; the hand-rolled form did the opposite on all three counts. That
# matters more than it looks, because these values are `export`ed — and compose
# gives the shell environment precedence over `.env`, so a mis-parse here
# silently OVERRODE a perfectly valid operator line and then blamed them for it
# (`TRINITY_IMAGE_TAG="v0.9.0"` became `"v0.9.0"`, the pull failed, and the
# error message pointed at "image-tag spelling").
#
# Behaviour verified against `docker compose config` (compose-go dotenv):
#     X="v0.9.0"        -> v0.9.0        (quotes stripped)
#     X=v0.9.0  # pin   -> v0.9.0        (inline comment stripped)
#     X=/srv/my dir     -> /srv/my dir   (internal spaces preserved)

# a TTY. Whatever gets generated is echoed back in the final summary.

# `--hosted` runs the SAME install against prebuilt GHCR images instead of
# building from source: docker-compose.hosted.yml plus a pulled-and-retagged
# agent base image. It is a flag on this script rather than a second script on
# purpose — everything else an install needs (secret generation, the
# ADMIN_PASSWORD contract #2381 made honest, DOCKER_GID detection, the serving
# health poll, the next-steps card) is identical, and a parallel copy of it is
# precisely the shape that has gone stale here before (#1039, #1056, #1707,

# --- Provision a bare cloud VM (--provision, #2380) ---------------------------
# Bring a BARE Ubuntu VM to the state the install below already assumes: Docker,
# a pinned Caddy terminating TLS on the machine's own public IP, a host
# firewall, and the handful of `.env` keys only the machine itself knows.
#
# It is a switch on this script for the same reason --hosted is one. This logic
# existed in THREE places — the Packer bakery (build time), the Packer first
# boot (per droplet), and a hand-written script pasted into the DigitalOcean
# deploy doc — and the copies had already drifted: the doc's port list and the
# image's disagreed, leaving the login page answering plain HTTP past the
# certificate (#2281 review C1). All three now enter here.
#
# Two phases, because a snapshot-based image splits them:
#   --machine-only  IP-independent, safe to bake into a disk image (packages,
#                   firewall unit). The Packer bakery calls this, and it exits
#                   without installing Trinity.
#   --site-only     what only a real instance knows: its own address — hence the
#                   Caddyfile, the certificate and the .env keys. Packer's first
#                   boot calls this, once per droplet, and continues into the
#                   normal install.
#   (neither)       both, in order: a doc-driven install on a fresh droplet.
#
# OFF by default, and it must stay inert on a developer laptop — it installs
# system packages, resets ufw and claims :80/:443. The guard is root + Linux + a
# reachable cloud metadata service, which no laptop satisfies.

# Issue #874 / #1131: backend runs as UID 1000 (non-root) but still needs to
# talk to /var/run/docker.sock, so compose joins it to the socket's group via
# `group_add: ["${DOCKER_GID:-999}"]`. The GID it must join is the group that
# owns the socket *as a container sees it*, which varies by runtime: a Linux
# bind mount exposes the host `docker` group (Debian/Ubuntu 999, RHEL/Fedora
# ~991, Arch 990); Docker Desktop / Colima / Rancher present it root-group-owned
# (GID 0). The old code wrongly assumed Docker Desktop *ignores* group_add and
# returned early on non-Linux, leaving the default 999 — Docker Desktop does
# NOT ignore it, so the backend was denied socket access and the Agents page
# silently showed "No agents" (#1131).
#
# So detect the value that is correct everywhere by probing the GID a throwaway
# container sees on the very socket compose mounts. The probe is the PRIMARY
# path on every runtime: a host-side `getent group docker` only sees the host
# docker group and silently mis-detects whenever the in-container socket GID
# differs from it — not just non-Linux, but Linux Docker Desktop / rootless /
# Colima too (all present the socket root-group-owned, GID 0, while a `docker`
# group may still exist on the host at some other GID). On a native Linux daemon
# the bind mount preserves the host docker-group GID, so the probe returns the
# same value `getent` would; `getent` survives only as the offline Linux
# fallback for when the probe can't run (daemon down, alpine unpullable, or
# SELinux denies the socket bind). An explicit DOCKER_GID=<n> in .env always
# wins (no probe). Note: by the time this runs the daemon must be up anyway —

# --- Docker Desktop Vector log-source fix (#1432) -----------------------------
# On Docker Desktop / VM-based Docker runtimes, Vector's default `docker_logs`
# source busy-loops and pegs the Docker VM at ~4 cores. Swap it for an on-disk
# file source via docker-compose.override.yml (auto-merged by `docker compose up`).
# Native Linux dockerd is unaffected. Opt out: TRINITY_LOCAL_LOG_SOURCE=docker.
# Force on: TRINITY_LOCAL_LOG_SOURCE=file. Default: auto-detect Docker Desktop.
# Hosted passes an explicit -f, which disables override AUTO-merge — but the
# override is still applicable, so it is appended to COMPOSE_FILES explicitly
# below rather than switched off. Forcing `_log_src=docker` under --hosted (as
# this first shipped) meant a hosted install on Docker Desktop or any VM-backed
# runtime shipped the very `docker_logs` source #1432 exists to avoid, and
# Vector busy-loops and pegs the Docker VM. The vector service is byte-identical
# between docker-compose.yml and the hosted file, so the override merges cleanly
# onto either.
