/**
 * The first-run hardening guide's contract (#2380) — since ent#581 the
 * `secure` step of the first-run overlay (`steps/StepSecure.vue`). Its
 * visibility now comes from the registry (`firstRunSteps.spec.js` pins the
 * provenance, admin and flags-loaded terms there); this file keeps the copy,
 * the stage logic, the store's fail-closed read and the step's structure.
 *
 * Three rules carry this surface, and none of them is visible to a structural
 * check:
 *
 *   1. **Never over an instance that isn't a marketplace droplet.** The gate is
 *      resolved server-side, and every failure path resolves to hidden. A
 *      missed nudge is a non-event; a "secure this instance" card sitting over
 *      a managed instance that is already behind Tailscale is an accusation
 *      nobody can act on.
 *   2. **Never before the answer arrives.** `hardeningGuideEligible` starts false,
 *      so a false→true flip after the fetch is indistinguishable from a real
 *      one — without the `featureFlagsLoaded` term the card flashes in on every
 *      page load.
 *   3. **Never a claim that wasn't measured.** The posture is derived by string
 *      -parsing the URL the instance ADVERTISES; nothing probes a socket or
 *      reads a certificate. The copy is asserted here so a later edit cannot
 *      quietly promote it to a verdict about the actual connection.
 *   4. **Never to someone who cannot act on it.** Settings → General is
 *      `adminOnly`, so for a non-admin the card's one button falls through to
 *      the default tab — and the copy would be disclosing the box's network
 *      posture to every user of it.
