/**
 * trinity#2559 — the Agent Detail voice overlay is retired; Talk is a door.
 *
 * This is a source-guard spec, the project's pattern for wiring that only source
 * can answer: vitest runs `environment: 'node'` with no component-mount harness.
 * The rules themselves (the `?voice=1` one-shot) are pure functions and are
 * tested as functions in `portalVoiceMode.spec.js`; what is left here is
 * *absence* — that a removal stayed removed — plus the two things this PR added
 * to `AgentHeader` and the one line it must NOT have removed from the composable.
 *
 * The load-bearing case is the last one. `useVoiceSession` returned
 * `start, startWith, stop, …` as shorthand. Deleting `start()` and leaving the
 * shorthand throws `ReferenceError: start is not defined` at setup in EVERY
 * consumer — including the Workspace conversation, the surface this whole change
 * hands off to — and it ships green through the rest of the suite, because
 * `src/frontend` has no lint script and no eslint config on disk, Rollup does not
 * error on an unresolved shorthand, and no spec *imports* the composable.

// trips — an assertion about the code: a comment explaining what NOT to write
// necessarily contains the offending string. The shared helper (#2161) is the
// one to use; do not re-copy it.
//
// **`ChatInput.vue` is the one file it cannot be used on unmodified.** It
// contains `accept="image/*"`, and the helper's JS block-comment pass reads that
// `/*` as an opener and swallows everything to the next `*/` — 74% of the file,
// including the `defineEmits` line this spec pins. Found by this spec failing on
// arrival, which is the good outcome; the bad one is the mirror image, where a
// swallowed file makes an *absence* assertion pass for the wrong reason. That is
// why every stripped source below is checked against a sentinel it must still
// contain: a future stripping change can then only fail loudly, never quietly.
