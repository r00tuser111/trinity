 *
 * ONE implementation, three consumers — the conversation, the room, and the
 * rail's Files tab. The issue says so explicitly ("Do not build a second drop
 * implementation"), and the reason is visible in what it was fixing: the drop
 * gesture already existed on the Files panel and the batch bug existed there
 * too, because each surface had written its own `files?.[0]`.
 *
 * What this owns:
 *   - the drag-over state and the file-vs-text discrimination;
 *   - the batch loop, with per-file outcome;
 *   - the per-file rejection copy.
 *
 * What it does NOT own: where the files go. That is the caller's `upload`
 * function, so the destination can move to the ent#484/#486 working folder
 * without the gesture changing.
