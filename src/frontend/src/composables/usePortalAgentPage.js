/**
 * The agent's own page payload, shared by the two surfaces that split it
 * (ent#523).
 *
 * `PortalAgentPage.vue` used to be one component owning one fetch. ent#523
 * splits what it showed across two surfaces that are on screen at DIFFERENT
 * times — the top band (stats + the Activity chart, always visible above the
 * conversation) and the Agent-details panel (chats, what it can do, reports,
 * opened on demand into the rail's place). Both read the same
 * `GET /agents/{name}/page` payload.
 *
 * So the fetch moves here rather than being duplicated or lifted into
 * `Portal.vue`: two components issuing the same request would double every
 * agent page load, and hoisting it into the view would put a per-agent fetch in
 * a shell that is not always showing an agent.
 *
 * The module-level cache is deliberately keyed by `${agent}:${window}` and
 * CLEARED on any agent change (#2160): keyed-by-name alone once served one
 * agent's page under another's name during a fast switch, and a stale band is
 * the same defect one surface along.

// Shared across every consumer in the SPA session — that is the point: the band
// mounts with the conversation and the details panel mounts later, and the
// second one should not re-pay for a payload the first already has.
//
// #2580: entries are `{ payload, fetchedAt }`, not the bare payload, because the
// cache now has to answer two questions and not one — "do we have this?" and
// "is it recent enough not to re-ask?". See `PAGE_FRESH_MS`.

// The band lives inside `PortalConversation`, which is keyed on the thread, so
// every chat-tab switch destroys and rebuilds it. That produced two visible
// faults — a skeleton/scanline flash, and a fresh `GET /agents/{name}/page` per
// switch — for numbers that had not moved. This window removes the second; the
// synchronous seed below removes the first.
//
// 30s, and the number is a judgement rather than a measurement: an agent's
// 7-day task counts do not meaningfully change inside half a minute, and the
// band is not a live surface (in-flight work is the rail's Work tab, which has
// its own feed). Long enough that rapid tab-switching costs nothing; short
// enough that a person who sends a turn and looks up sees it counted.
//
// Deliberately NOT a "never refetch" cache: `reload` and an agent change both
// bypass it, and a plain remount after the window still refetches — the
// staleness ceiling stays bounded rather than becoming "whatever was true when
// this tab was opened".

 * #2580 — should `load` go to the network?

 * `environment: 'node'` with no component-mount harness, so a decision left
 * inline in the composable is a decision no test can execute. This is the one
 * piece of `load` that is a judgement rather than plumbing.
 *
 * `force` (the ent#253 retry) always refetches; a miss always refetches; a hit
 * refetches only once it is older than the window. A malformed entry — no
 * `fetchedAt`, a non-numeric one, a clock that jumped backwards — is treated as
 * STALE rather than fresh: the failure mode of an unnecessary request is a
 * duplicate fetch, and of a wrongly-fresh one is a band that never updates
 * again for the life of the tab.
