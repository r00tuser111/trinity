/**
 * The Files tab's pure rules (#2582 / ent#548) — what to preview, in what
 * order, and who may do what to a row.
 *
 * Pure by design: `vitest.config.js` pins `environment: 'node'`, so a rule that
 * lives in a `.vue` file is a rule no unit test can reach. Everything here is a
 * function of its arguments.
 *
 * ## `flattenFiles` owns BOTH the render order and the preview index
 *
 * The template used to render two `<ul>`s per participant while the modal
 * walked its own list. Two orderings drift, and when they do the modal opens the
 * WRONG FILE — silently, with no error anywhere. So there is one flat list, the
 * template renders it with a computed group header, and `neighbour()` indexes
 * into the same array.
 *
 * ## Why `groups` is a parameter and not two hard-coded collections
 *
 * ent#548's Technical Notes require preview and delete to "carry over unchanged"
 * when ent#484's per-agent shared working folder lands. With this signature that
 * folder is a third entry in `groups` and nothing structural changes. It is free
 * now and a rewrite later.

 * against the stored row rather than signed over the URL. Dropping the origin
 * therefore costs nothing and buys a fetch that CSP `connect-src 'self'` and
 * CORS both allow. `download_url` is untouched: it stays the shareable link the
 * anchor-click Download uses, with #2582's one-way `&download=1` intact.
 *
 * The slice is taken FROM the route, not from the path root, because that is the
 * exact inverse of the server's `f"{base}/api/files/{fid}"` — so a portal base
 * URL carrying a path prefix (`https://host/trinity`) resolves to the same
 * `/api/files/{id}` on this origin instead of a path this origin never serves.
 * `lastIndexOf` rather than `indexOf` for the same reason: the route is appended
 * last. The output is therefore ALWAYS either unchanged or a path under
 * `/api/files/` — the rewrite cannot be steered at another route.
 *
 * A url with no `/api/files/` in its path is left to `sameOriginPath`'s unchanged
 * behaviour: we do not know what it is, so we do not invent a local path for it.
 *
 * The caller fetches this with a bare `fetch`, NOT through `api.js` — that the
 * url is now same-origin makes an `api.js` call look tempting, and it would
 * attach the platform JWT to a route whose whole design is that the `sig` token
 * is the only credential.
 *
 * The route check SELECTS a route; it does not SANITISE one. `%2f` survives
 * `new URL()` un-decoded, so do not reuse this helper for a user-supplied URL.
 * It is safe here because `download_url` is server-built from an admin-set
 * `portal_base_url` plus a DB id, and the fetch carries no ambient credential
 * (Trinity sets no cookies; the portal authenticates with a Bearer header).
