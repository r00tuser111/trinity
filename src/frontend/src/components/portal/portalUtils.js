 * returns null for every state except `stopped` and `unavailable`, so on a

 * identical truncation point survives, and free when there is nothing to hold
 * space for.

 * by search or by the collapse limit would otherwise reserve width on a list
 * that shows no chip, which is the original bug with extra steps.

 * in view stops) reflows the whole list once, where before it reflowed nothing.

 *     uses, NOT a plain `boundCandidates` slice. A slice is rank-ordered, so an
 *     agent with an open ask can fall past the window and be hidden from the
