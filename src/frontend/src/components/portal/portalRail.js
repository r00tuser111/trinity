/**
 * Workspace conversation rail — the tab contract and every decidable rule
 * (trinity-enterprise#474, slice 1 of #472). Pure.
 *
 * The rail is the collapsible third column beside the conversation. It invents
 * no rules of its own; it collects ones already ruled on #472 and the approved
 * design pass (ent#474, 2026-09-06):
 *
 *   * a TAB declares its label, its DOOR, its participant SCOPING, its EMPTY
 *     STATE and its activity SIGNAL — nothing docks into the rail without all
 *     five, which is what stops each capability re-deciding its own placement;
 *   * the rail renders ONLY tabs whose door the current session passes, and a
 *     failed door means the tab's body is never mounted — so nothing it would
 *     fetch is ever requested (`visibleTabs` is the one gate, for render AND
 *     for mount);
 *   * collapsed by default (operator ruling 2026-09-02); open/collapsed and the
 *     active tab persist across chat switches under ONE localStorage key;
 *   * a collapsed rail still says which tabs have live activity, in two
 *     shapes and one hue (principle 24): "live now" (a ringed, pulsing dot) and
 *     "updated since last view" (a plain dot);
 *   * a room shows ONE rail; every tab groups its content by participating
 *     agent, and an agent with nothing in flight still gets its row.
 *
 * Every rule here is a pure function because `vitest.config.js` pins
 * `environment: 'node'` with no component-mount harness — a rule inside an SFC
 * is a rule no test can reach. `PortalRail.vue` and `PortalRailStrip.vue` are
 * dispatchers over this module.

 * What the Files tab's dot and its seen-marker BOTH read (#2582).
 *
 * The signal was keyed on `feeds.documents` and `created_at` alone, so a file
 * the client had just sent could never light it. Merging uploads INTO
 * `documents` would break the two-list UI split ("Files you sent" / "Files from
 * {agent}"), so the collections stay separate and only this projection joins
 * them: each upload is republished under the `created_at` key the existing
 * `updatedSignal` / `markSeen` pair already compares.
 *
 * One mechanism, tested once — and it must feed BOTH sides, or opening the tab
 * would mark documents seen while leaving the uploads' dot lit forever.
 *
 * Stated limit: `uploads` is populated only on tab-open, a turn ending while
 * Files is open, or a `noteUpload`. On a fresh page load with Files closed this
 * sees `{}`, so the dot cannot light for an upload made on another device or in
 * a previous session. That is also what stops a one-time false-dot burst on
 * deploy.
 *
 * Clock note: `uploaded_at` is a CONTAINER mtime while `created_at` is a backend
 * `utc_now_iso()`, and one marker covers both — so a badly skewed agent clock
 * can park the marker ahead and swallow a later real share. Narrow, and stated.
