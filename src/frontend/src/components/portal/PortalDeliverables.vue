  <!-- ent#365: deliverables produced in THIS chat, as cards in the chat.
       Reports were operator-scoped scrollback before this: an agent published
       one and the person it was for had no way to see it except by asking. The
       card is the thing itself — type, when, and the payload one click away —
       rendered through the SAME `components/reports/` dispatch the agent page
       and Agent Detail use (Technical Notes: "do not build a second rendering
       layer"). -->
