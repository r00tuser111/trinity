// Every decision the composer makes about the model control lives here as a
// pure function, for the reason `portalVoiceMode.js` states and this repo keeps
// re-learning: vitest runs `environment: 'node'` with no component-mount
// harness, so a rule kept inside a `.vue` file is a rule no test can reach.
// The component is a dispatcher over these.
//
// There is deliberately NO storage access in this module. The choice is the
// user's SERVER record (`user_preferences` key `workspace_model`), read and
// written through `stores/userPreferences.js` — so there is no identity term to
// resolve here, and none of the `anon`-then-email race that a browser key on
// this surface would reintroduce (`composables/useColumnResize.js`, caught live).
