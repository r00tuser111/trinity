/**
 * Carrying a composer's attachments from a 1:1 into the room it escalates to
 * (#2794). Pure.
 *
 * The gap this closes: `PortalConversation` uploads each dropped file straight
 * into the CURRENT agent's inbox as it is attached, and the `escalate-to-room`
 * event carried only `{ agents, message }` — so a message that @mentioned a
 * second agent moved to a room and the file did not. The person had watched a
 * chip say the upload succeeded, so they believed both agents had it; only the
 * original one ever did, and the room showed no trace of a file at all.
 *
 * The rule the issue states, and the one everything here follows: *whatever a
 * user could do inside a room, escalating into one from a 1:1 must produce the
 * same result.* A room-native drop is one upload per participant
 * (`PortalRoom.vue`), so an escalation owes the participants that have not
 * already received the file exactly that — no more (the origin agent must not
 * be sent the same file twice) and no less.
 *
 * Every rule is a pure function because `vitest.config.js` pins
 * `environment: 'node'` with no component-mount harness: a decision made inside
 * an SFC is a decision no test can reach. `PortalConversation.vue`,
 * `Portal.vue` and `PortalRoom.vue` are dispatchers over this module.

/**
 * Split a composer's entries into what can travel and what cannot.
 *
 * `carried` is the files that actually reached the origin agent AND still hold
 * a readable handle — both are required, and the second is not paranoia: an
 * entry restored across a failed escalation, or one built by an older code
 * path, has no `file`, and a plan built from it would fan out `undefined`.
 *
 * `dropped` is everything else, kept rather than discarded so the person can
 * be TOLD. Silence is the one outcome the AC forbids.
 *
 * Anything still uploading counts as dropped — callers are expected to await
 * `settled()` first, so an in-flight entry reaching here means the wait was
 * skipped, and reporting it is strictly better than assuming it landed.

/**
 * The one carry set, from BOTH upload surfaces.
 *
 * The composer is not the only way to attach a file: the rail's Files panel
 * (`PortalRailFiles.vue`) sends straight to its "Send to" target and keeps no
 * pending state, so a person who attached there and then @mentioned a second
 * agent had nothing carried — and, because the composer held no attachments,
 * not even a notice saying so. Both surfaces funnel through
 * `clientPortal.uploadDocument`, which logs them; this merges the two views.
 *
 * Composer entries WIN a tie: they carry the live per-file outcome the chip is
 * rendering, and the carry-log entry is the same upload seen from the funnel.
 * Identity is `name + size` rather than the `File` object, because the two
 * surfaces hold different references to the same upload only when the composer
 * was used — dedup by reference would double-carry every composer file.
 *
 * Rail entries are normalised into the entry shape the rest of this module
 * speaks (`partitionAttachments` reads `attachmentState`), and they are
 * `done: true` by construction: `uploadDocument` logs only after the server
 * took the file.
