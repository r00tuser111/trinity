       ALWAYS visible (operator, 2026-09-06: "I don't see on the top panel for
       the agent the details we have on the Workspace right now, like the chart
       with the executions"). It is the half of the old agent page that answers
       "how is this agent doing"; the half that answers "what has it got"
       moved to the Agent-details panel.

       Deliberately not collapsible. A control that hides the one thing the
       operator asked to always see would re-create the state they objected
       to, one click deeper. -->

      <!-- #2597: a failed FIRST load is the first ARM of this chain, not a
           banner above it and not a replacement for the whole row.

           An arm, because the `v-else` branch renders `stats`, which falls back
           to `{ total_executions: 0 }` — zeros are a claim about performance
           where "no data" is a claim about nothing, so anything that let them
           render here would be the very defect this fixes.

           Inside the row, because the window `<select>` below is a sibling of
           this chain rather than part of it: replacing the whole row took the
           selector away with the numbers, and changing the window is a second
           way out of a failure (`watch(timeWindow)` re-fetches) alongside the
           retry. `InlineError` is row-shaped, so it costs no layout — the same
           is NOT true of `LoadFailed`, whose centred `py-6` column in a
           `py-2.5` band would roughly triple its height and shift the
           conversation column (contract principle 4). It is also the primitive
           the failed-REFRESH case at the bottom of this file already uses, so
           the band has one failure language rather than two. -->

      <!-- Bounded, not flexed to fill. Stretched across the whole band a 7-day
           window gives ~150px-wide columns, so a single execution renders as a
           slab rather than a bar — board A3's chart is a compact block beside
           the figures, not a full-width plot. -->
      <!-- ent#547 — THE HEIGHT RULE, and the thing to preserve if you edit this
           block. A stat block above is 39px (an 18px figure over an 11px
           caption), so with the band's 8px padding the floor is 55px + 1px
           border WHATEVER the chart does. This column is therefore budgeted at
           exactly 39px — title 10 + `mb-1.5` 6 + a 23px row — which makes the
           chart free: it can never lengthen the band, and shrinking it further
           would buy nothing. Go over 39 and every pixel is one the band grows.
           The `min-h` matches the bar height rather than the old 52px so the
           chart, its scanline, "no activity" and "unavailable" all share ONE
           footprint (contract principle 4) instead of the row resizing per
           state.
           What used to make this column tall was the LEGEND, not the bars: laid
           out `flex-col` it grew ~13px per bucket, so a nine-bucket agent's band
           ran to ~153px. `legend="none"` is most of the compaction; the tooltip
           carries series identity, and it names every bucket with its swatch,
           its count and the day's total. -->

                 chart can afford one of the two, and the title is the one board
