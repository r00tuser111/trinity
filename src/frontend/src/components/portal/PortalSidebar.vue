               "Right-align the dates" is not an alignment class here — the span
               was already `shrink-0` directly after a `flex-1` name block, i.e.
               as far right as it could get. It read as ragged for two other

               you have never talked to, which moved the whole row's truncation
               point. `w-14 text-right` fixes the column; rendering it always
               (the `v-if` moved inside) keeps the name's truncation point
               identical on every row — the same reason the availability slot
               below reserves its own footprint. `tabular-nums` was already

               resource-saving posture) would get an entirely inert Workspace.
               The chip sets the expectation; the server's 502 is the honest
               refusal. Nothing is rendered for `ready` or `unknown`.

               The slot's footprint is RESERVED so a row does not reflow when an
               agent starts or stops between refreshes — the same reason the
               roster is not re-sorted by this.

               #2641: the reservation is a property of the LIST, not of a row.
               `availabilityChip` answers null for everything except `stopped`
               and `unavailable`, so on a fleet where everything is running the
               strip was empty on EVERY row — which is why the dates stopped
               72px short of the right edge and the name was charged 72px for
               nothing. Reserved on every row iff any VISIBLE row can show a
               chip: uniform down the list, so #2580's identical truncation
               point survives, and absent entirely when there is nothing to hold
               space for, which puts the date flush against the row's edge.

               The whole element goes, not just its width — a zero-width flex
               child still sits between the date and the edge, and `gap-2.5` on
               the row would keep paying 10px for it. -->
