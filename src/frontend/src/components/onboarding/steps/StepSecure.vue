<!--
  Step `secure` (ent#581) — absorbs the first-run hardening guide (#2380/#2564).

  Both stages in one step: the domain field on the face, the reasoning and the
  Cloudflare Tunnel guidance behind a native <details>. The posture copy lives
  in `hardeningGuide.js`, unchanged, and the four properties that carried the
  card still hold:

  1. The gate is `hardening_guide_eligible`, resolved server-side — PROVENANCE,
     never TLS state, so this never appears over a managed instance already
     behind Tailscale. The registry predicate reads it; this file does not.
  2. Admins only (`eligible` in firstRunSteps.js): the copy discloses the box's
     network posture, and the setting it writes is admin-only.
  3. Self-retiring: saving a domain IS the completion condition. The step then
     reads done and speaks only to the tunnel, which is optional.
  4. It claims only what is known. The posture is string-parsed from the URL
     this instance is configured to hand out — nothing opens a socket or reads
     a certificate — so the copy says "advertises", never "secure".
