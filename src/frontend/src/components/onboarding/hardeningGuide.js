/**
 * What the card is allowed to say, per posture.
 *
 * The binding constraint (an explicit AC) is honesty about what is actually
 * known. `install_tls_posture` is derived by PURE STRING PARSING of the URL this
 * instance is configured to ADVERTISE — nothing probes a socket, opens a
 * connection, or reads a certificate, because TLS terminates outside the
 * backend. So no sentence here may assert a property of the actual connection:
 * not that it is secure, not that a certificate is browser-trusted or issued by
 * anyone in particular, and not that anything "works today" or is "not broken".
 * All three are claims about a wire this code has never touched.
 *
 * `https-ip` therefore says what it can see (an address) and what an install of
 * this shape is KNOWN to set up (a short-lived IP-bound certificate, hedged as
 * an expectation), then argues the upgrade from properties of the ADDRESS —
 * that it is awkward to share and answers to the whole public internet — which
 * are readable from the string itself. The renewal caveat is worded the same way
 * and for the same reason: a ~6-day certificate renewed only while the machine
 * runs is a property of that certificate PROFILE, so it is stated as what such a
 * setup does after a long shutdown, never as a claim about this instance's
 * current certificate or its expiry.
 *
 * `http` is the one posture that names an exposure, and it still hedges: a
 * proxy in front of Trinity may already terminate TLS, in which case the
 * advertised address is stale rather than dangerous, and from here the two are
 * indistinguishable.
 *
 * Badge variants are chosen so none of them screams "broken": `neutral` for an
 * absence of information, `warning` for the posture whose advertised address
 * carries no encryption, `info` for one with room to improve.
 *
 * `https-domain` is the one posture that speaks only to step two: step one is
 * already done, so its copy opens on what is left rather than on an exposure.
