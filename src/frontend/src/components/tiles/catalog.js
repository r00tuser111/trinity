/**
 * Grid info-tile catalog (trinity-enterprise#325).
 *
 * Imported for its SIDE EFFECT by `FleetGrid.vue`: each entry registers into
 * the `GRID_WIDGETS` registry in `utils/gridWidgets.js`. That module stays
 * free of `.vue` imports so it remains unit-testable under vitest's node
 * environment — this file is where the component references live instead.
 *
 * Adding a tile (epic #94 sub-issues #95-#101, #259) is one block here plus
 * the component. Components are imported eagerly, not lazily: a tile that
 * fails to resolve should break the build rather than render as a silent
 * blank cell on an operator's dashboard.

  // a permanently-erroring tile pointing at a page they cannot open. The flag
