/**
 * Subscription pressure (ent#259) — per-SUBSCRIPTION headroom at a glance, so
 * "how much is left on any of my subscriptions?" is answerable from the board
 * instead of Settings → Integrations.
 *
 * Deliberately the inverse unit of #471's per-agent chip. That chip answers
 * "is THIS agent's funding under strain"; it structurally cannot answer which
 * subscription is the bottleneck, because agents share a subscription and burn
 * one 5h window between them — reading it off the board means grouping every
 * agent chip into buckets by eye, which is exactly the work a tile should do.
 *
 * ZERO backend change, per the operator's ruling on the issue (2026-08-19):
 * "a small build on GET /api/agents/subscription-pressure + the extended
 * GET /api/subscriptions/{id}/usage once #471 merges". Both endpoints exist;
 * `stores/subscriptions.js::fetchPressureData` composes them on the Grid's one
 * 60s visibility-aware batch poll. This component never fetches — viewport
 * culling UNMOUNTS a tile, so an `onMounted` fetch would re-issue on every pan
 * and the data must already be warm when the operator pans back.
 *
 * Every decision lives in `utils/subscriptionPressureTile.js`, because vitest
 * runs node-environment here — a rule inside this SFC is a rule no test can
 * reach. That includes the row counts: past the fixed track count a row is
 * clipped by `InfoTile`'s `overflow: hidden` without ellipsis or scroll, so the
 * pure function returns `visibleRows`/`totalRows` and the stamp discloses the
 * overflow rather than letting rows vanish silently.
 *
 * Honesty rules it carries (ent#259 AC#2/#5, and #471's source contract):
 *  - a real utilization % is shown ONLY when the provider snapshot is fresh
 *    (`source=anthropic`, age ≤ 30 min); otherwise the row falls back to the
 *    qualitative state and shows no number at all. #471 established the number
 *    is real — the AC's "never a fake-precise X% left" is about framing
 *    (consumed, sourced) rather than about hiding a genuine reading.
 *  - "429s" counts the `rate_limit` kind only, never the failure total, which
 *    also carries auth failures and pre-#471 unclassified rows.
 *  - a failed usage read renders that row as unavailable — never as zeroes,
 *    and never as a healthy subscription.
