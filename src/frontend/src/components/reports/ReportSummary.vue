/**
 * The CLIENT-FACING fallback for a payload no typed renderer can present (#2162).
 *
 * Passed to `ReportRenderer` as `:fallback-component` by the Workspace agent
 * page, and by nothing else. The operator surfaces keep `ReportJson`, and that
 * split IS the design rather than an omission — AC #2 asks for a fallback
 * "deliberately stricter than the operator side, because the audience is an
 * external client". A raw dump is a FEATURE when you are debugging an agent's
 * own output and a defect when the reader is that agent's customer.
 *
 * So there is deliberately no raw-payload escape hatch in here, and adding one
 * would re-open the bug: the override covers an agent-chosen
 * `display_hint: "json"` as well as a shape mismatch (`json` is a valid value in
 * the MCP tool's enum), so a disclosure would hand the client the dump by either
 * route.
 *
 * All the logic lives in `reportSummary.js`; this file is a dumb renderer,
 * because there is no component-mount harness here and logic written inline
 * would ship untested.
