/**
 * Summarise an unrecognised report payload for a human (#2162).
 *
 * The shared renderer set's fallback used to be the raw JSON viewer. That is
 * defensible for an operator and wrong for an external client: `payload` is
 * free-form agent-authored JSON, the same category as an operator-queue ask's
 * `context`, which the Workspace refuses to expose at all because it has been a
 * credential-leak surface before (canary G-04). The Reports tab was dumping it
 * key-for-key.
 *
 * This is the readable replacement — and the whole of the fallback's logic,
 * deliberately: there is no component-mount harness in this project, so a
 * summariser written inline in a `.vue` template would be untestable. The
 * component around it is a dumb renderer.
 *
 * Three properties, each load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. **It never stringifies the payload.** Not once, not for a nested value.
 *      `JSON.stringify` anywhere in here would reintroduce the bug through the
 *      component that exists to fix it, so depth is 1 and a nested value is
 *      described ("12 items", "4 fields") rather than serialised.
 *
 *   2. **It is bounded.** ≤40 entries with a counted remainder, values truncated
 *      at ~200 chars. An agent can file 5 MiB; a summary that grows with the
 *      payload is the same unbounded page the design contract's principle 28
 *      forbids, just with nicer type.
 *
 *   3. **It redacts credential-shaped tokens at VALUE level, anywhere in the
 *      string.** Not by key name: an allow-list of "safe" keys is both a dead
 *      end here (the fallback fires precisely on payloads nobody has seen, so an
 *      allow-list blanks nearly all of them) and ineffective, because an
 *      allowed key's value can carry the secret — `{"status": "failed: sk-…"}`
 *      is the case that motivated this. Patterns mirror G-04's set.
 *
 * **Honest scope.** This is defense-in-depth on the FALLBACK path only. A
 * well-shaped `markdown` or `table` report still renders its values as authored,
 * and a key-value summary still names every top-level key — it bounds and
 * humanises the residual, it does not eliminate the class. The general fix is a
 * scrub at the portal read boundary, which is a security change to a shipping
 * read path and deserves its own review rather than riding a UI fix. The helper
 * below is written so it can move there without rework.

 * (a detector only needs to prove a prefix exists; a redactor that stops after
 * one character leaves the rest of the secret on screen), and they are applied
 * as replacements rather than reported by name.
 *
 * `\b` before each prefix is what keeps "task-force" from matching `sk-`; it
 * treats `_` as a word character exactly as the Python side does, so the two
 * agree on `my_github_pat_x` (no match, no boundary) by construction.
