<!--
  A canvas as a DOCUMENT (ent#554).

  One renderer for the printable form, shared by the shared-link page and every
  authenticated surface's "Download PDF". AC #7 asks that the PDF be identical
  wherever it is produced from; the only way to promise that is for there to be
  one component producing it, rather than each surface printing its own layout.

  The blocks still go through `CanvasBlock`, so the document cannot drift from
  the screen either — this adds the frame (title, agent, freshness, generated
  date) and the page rules, not a second rendering of the content.

  Always the LIGHT rendering (AC #7): the print rules force white regardless of
  the viewer's theme, because a dark canvas printed as-is wastes a cartridge and
  reads badly on paper.
