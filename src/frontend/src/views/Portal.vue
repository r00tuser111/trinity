    <!-- ent#492: a flex row whose fixed columns take their width from the
         resize variables, and the conversation is `flex-1 min-w-0` — the
         flexible middle BY CONSTRUCTION, so it never carries a width of its own
         and cannot be dragged directly. Widening the messages is done by
         narrowing a neighbour, which is what the AC asks for.

         The issue's technical notes suggested `grid-template-columns`, and the
         first cut did that. It is wrong here: the rail handle is conditional
         (AC 1 — present only while there is a column to drag), so the number of
         grid children CHANGES, and with the handle absent the rail fell into
         the handle's track and the track meant for it stayed empty. A grid
         places children by count; flex does not care. Caught live — the rail's
         expand button was in the DOM and never became clickable.

         Below `sm` the columns collapse to the single stage the drawer and the
         bottom sheet already assume, so the variables are simply unused. -->

           40/60. Below `sm` the orb has the whole stage. -->
      <!-- During a call (ent#534) the orb and the canvas split the space
           BESIDE the sidebar 40 / 60 as flex shares (2 : 3 of a zero basis),
           not as percentages of the whole row: `w-[40%]` + `w-[60%]` next to
           an 18rem sidebar summed to 100% + 18rem, and the shell's
           `overflow-hidden` clipped the canvas column off the right edge with
           no scrollbar — the #2581 report, measured at 296px on a 1280px
           viewport by the gallery (#2583). -->
      <!-- #2640: the share ANIMATES rather than snapping. `flex-grow` is a
           `<number>` and therefore animatable, so transitioning it moves this
           column between its 1 (no call) and 2 (call) shares continuously —
           which is also why the shares stay shares. Reverting to `w-[40%]` /
           `w-[60%]` would animate just as well and re-open #2581: those summed
           to 100% + an 18rem sidebar and the shell clipped the canvas column
           off the right edge.

           The canvas column opposite ramps its own grow 0 → 3 over the same
           duration and easing, so the two interpolate together and the swap
           reads as one motion instead of two.

           Under `prefers-reduced-motion` it is instant, and that takes BOTH
           classes. `transition-none` emits only `transition-property: none`;
           `duration-300` still applies, so `transitionDuration` stays `.3s` —
           and Vue's `getTransitionInfo` reads exactly that property to decide
           how long to keep a leaving element alive. With `transition-none`
           alone nothing animates but every `@after-leave` is still gated on a
           300ms fallback timer, which is how a reduced-motion user ended up
           watching the canvas vanish, an empty column, and then the rail pop
           in. `motion-reduce:duration-0` drives the timeout to 0. -->

             thread's own URL as soon as the list is in hand. The skeleton below
             covers that beat, so nothing renders here.

             ent#360's reasoning is not reverted — an agent still has a home with
             its history, what it can do and a place to ask you something. It is

          <!-- ent#523: the agent's numbers, always visible UNDER the header
               (operator, 2026-09-06: a band "under the header"). Mounted by the
               shell because the shell owns which agent is on screen.
               #2580: the band is keyed on the AGENT, which is the issue's own
               words for the rule. It stays in this slot rather than being
               hoisted to a sibling of the conversation, and that is a decision,
               not an oversight: hoisting is the only way to keep the component
               INSTANCE across a thread switch, but slot content renders where
               the child puts it — and the child puts this below its `h-14`
               header, which is where the operator ruled it goes. Hoisted, the
               band renders above the agent picker, so you read an agent's
               numbers before its name.
               So the remount is left in place and made FREE instead: see
               `usePortalAgentPage`, which now serves the cached payload
               synchronously during setup (so `loaded` is true on the first
               paint — no skeleton, no scanline) and skips the refetch inside a
               freshness window (no request). Every symptom the issue lists —
               re-render, refetch, scanline, flicker — is gone; what survives is
               a cheap instance re-creation nobody can see.
               Making it literal means lifting the header out of
               `PortalConversation` so the band can sit between them as a
               sibling. That is a real refactor (the header reads `currentThread`,
               `isMainChat`, `resetting`, `sending` and the voice state) and it
               is the follow-up, not this PR. -->

           the grow-0 class is deliberate — `grow-0` and `sm:flex-[3_1_0%]` are
           both single-class selectors, so without it which one wins would be
           decided by Tailwind's output order rather than by intent.

           re-wrapping in view while the column is still moving (the layout

      <!-- #2640: `v-if`, no longer `v-else-if` — the canvas above is inside a
           <Transition> now, so the two are no longer adjacent siblings and the
           chain is broken. The condition is written out instead: the rail has
           the column whenever the canvas does not. Stated rather than inferred,
           because a `v-else-if` silently becoming a `v-if` is how both columns
           end up on screen at once.

           #2676: the rail column is a WIDTH, so it moves with the canvas
           instead of stepping. It used to be a bare `v-if` on a `shrink-0` flex
           sibling carrying no width transition, so it appeared at its full size
           in one frame — 48px collapsed, 384px open, or whatever `--ws-rail`
           was dragged to, which on a wide rail is a bigger jump than the 211px
           snap #2640 removed.

           The width lives on a WRAPPER this view owns, not on `PortalRail`'s
           own `<aside>` — the same shape the sidebar column three columns to
           the left already has (`shrink-0 overflow-hidden` + an explicit
           `--ws-` width). `--ws-rail` is the RENDERED width (48px collapsed,
           the dragged width open), so one binding covers both states and the
           inner aside's own width agrees with it at rest.

           Why Vue enter/leave classes rather than a `transition-[width]` that
           is always on: the same variable is written on every `pointermove` of
           a drag, and a permanently-transitioned width would make dragging the
           rail rubber-band by 300ms. Vue adds the active class only for the
           enter/leave window and removes it after, so a drag is instant exactly
           as it is today. `!w-0` is `!`-marked for the reason the canvas's
           `!grow-0` is: both are single-class selectors setting the same
           property, so without it Tailwind's output order would decide.

           This also RETIRES `voiceCanvasLeaving`. That flag existed because a
           rail mounting at full width beside a still-shrinking canvas put three
           columns in a row sized for two. A rail that enters from zero width is
           complementary to a canvas leaving towards zero grow — the row's total
           is conserved at every frame — so the hazard is gone by construction
           rather than held off by a flag, and the two motions now overlap
           instead of running back to back. -->
