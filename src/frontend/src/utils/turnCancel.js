 * Workspace) and each owns a different transport, a different auth credential
 * and a different composer. What they must NOT own separately is the two rules
 * a person actually notices: when Escape means "stop" and what happens to the
 * text they typed. Those live here, as pure functions, because
 * `vitest.config.js` runs `environment: 'node'` with no mount harness — a rule
 * decided inside an SFC is a rule no test can reach.
