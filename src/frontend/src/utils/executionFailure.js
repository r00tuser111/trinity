/**
 * Pure helpers for the Grid's "Recent failures" info tile (ent#100).
 *
 * Everything the tile decides lives here rather than in the SFC, because
 * `vitest.config.js` pins `environment: 'node'` — a pure module is the only
 * part of a tile that can be unit-tested at all. The tile is then a thin
 * renderer over these three functions.
 *
 * ## This module is NOT a failure classifier, and that is the point
 *
 * ent#100's acceptance criteria ask for error-code tags from the platform's
 * taxonomy (AUTH, TIMEOUT, AGENT_ERROR, …). `TaskExecutionErrorCode` is an
 * IN-MEMORY enum on `TerminalEnvelope`: `schedule_executions` has no
 * `error_code` column, so the code is discarded at the terminal write and
 * `FleetExecutionSummary.error_summary` is just `SUBSTR(error, 1, 200)`.
 *
 * Re-deriving the code here — from a 200-character truncation of a message the
 * backend knew the code for and threw away — would be a third, unenforced copy
 * of a classifier that already exists as a byte-identity-mirrored PAIR
 * (`src/backend/services/failure_classifier.py` ↔
 * `src/scheduler/failure_classifier.py`, pinned by
 * `tests/unit/test_904_sigkill_no_false_auth.py::TestBackendSchedulerParity`).
 * A guessed label on an operator's failure dashboard is worse than no label.
 *
 * So `failureCodeFromSummary` READS a marker the platform actually emitted and
 * returns `null` otherwise. Today the only writer of that marker is
 * `services/pull_coordination_service.py`, which architecture.md documents as
 * dark until a pull pilot — so on every current install the chip is absent and
 * the row spends its width on the real `error_summary` instead. When the
 * `error_code` column lands (follow-up, listed in the PR body), the chip starts
 * appearing with zero UI churn.

 * `[critical]` mid-sentence and mint its own chrome on a fleet dashboard.
 *
 * The charset is deliberately lower-case-only: `pull_coordination_service`
 * formats the plain `str` field, so the marker reads `[auth]`. Had it formatted

/**
 * The tile's whole state machine, as one pure function (ent#100).
 *
 * ## Why the green state needs a POSITIVE signal, not an absence of rows
 *
 * "No failures in 24h ✓" is a positive claim about the fleet on the fleet's own
 * monitoring surface. There are three independent routes to asserting it from a
 * FAULT, and all three are closed here:
 *
 *  1. **A failed list GET.** Design-contract principle 15 / #1926: an empty
 *     state requires a fetch that succeeded and returned zero, never
 *     `list.length === 0`.
 *  2. **A failed `/stats` GET.** The 24h total is a second request; if it fails
 *     while the list succeeds, the count is UNKNOWN — which is not zero. The
 *     count is never inferred from `items.length`, because a bounded page
 *     cannot produce a 24h total.
 *  3. **An unenumerable fleet.** `accessible_agent_names` resolves through
 *     `docker_service.list_all_agents_fast()`, which returns `[]` when the
 *     Docker client is None AND on ANY exception (denied socket, daemon
 *     restart, timeout — the warning is even throttled). For a non-admin that
 *     makes every fleet accessor early-return zeros at **HTTP 200**: the fetch
 *     "succeeds", `loaded` is honestly true, and a green all-clear is
 *     manufactured by an infrastructure fault. The same fault empties the
 *     Grid's own roster, so a non-empty roster is the positive enumerability
 *     signal available here with no backend change. (The durable fix is the
 *     ent#384 treatment — resolve the accessible set from
 *     `db.get_all_agent_metadata()` — which is a backend change and therefore
 *     out of ent#100's scope.)
 *
 * Note the asymmetry that makes this safe rather than merely cautious: a
 * refresh failure with rows already loaded stays `ready` (stale-while-revalidate,
 * principle 13) — it is only the CONFIRMATION that requires everything to be
 * green on this cycle.
 *
 * @param {object} o
 * @param {boolean} o.listLoaded   a list GET has succeeded at least once
 * @param {boolean} o.listError    the most recent list GET failed
 * @param {boolean} o.statsLoaded  a /stats GET has succeeded at least once
 * @param {boolean} o.statsError   the most recent /stats GET failed
 * @param {number}  o.itemCount    rows currently held
 * @param {number|null} o.failed24h  24h failure total; null = unknown
 * @param {number}  o.rosterSize   agents the Grid can currently enumerate
 * @returns {{state: string, emptyTitle: string, emptyHint: string, note: string|null}}
