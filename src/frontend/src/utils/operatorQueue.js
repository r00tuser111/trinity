/**
 * Operator-queue answers — the ONE home of the respond payload, the
 * controls-kind switch and the type labels (#2370).
 *
 * THE rule: `response` is the DECISION the agent reads — the chosen option,
 * the typed answer, or `acknowledged`; `response_text` is an optional
 * free-text note. Every frontend producer of
 * `POST /api/operator-queue/{id}/respond` builds its body here: the desktop
 * store (QueueCard / QueueItemDetail / acknowledgeItem all funnel through
 * `respondToItem`) and the `/m` mobile admin. The bug class this module closes
 * was a SECOND producer hand-building the body — `/m` POSTed a hard-coded
 * `response: 'approved'` with the tapped option in `response_text`, so a Deny
 * was recorded as an approval and a typed answer became a note. The sync
 * write-back copies `response` to the agent's queue file verbatim and the
 * ent#329 resume dispatch frames it as "the answer", so the field is
 * load-bearing.
 *
 * Known non-consumers: the Workspace asks panel posts to its own endpoint with
 * its own model (`client_portal/asks`) — tracked as #2375; the MCP tool is
 * TypeScript and cannot import this module.
 *
 * Pure and import-free: `vitest.config.js` pins `environment: 'node'`, so this
 * is the unit-testable home of the rules and the views are thin callers.

 * **The unknown-type default is `acknowledge`, and that changed (ent#499).** It
 * was `question`, which is wrong in both directions. `type` is free TEXT with no
 * CHECK and the platform already emits non-protocol types (`skill_not_found`,
 * #1410; `workspace_problem_report`, ent#499) — those are INFORMATIONAL, nothing
 * is waiting on an answer, and offering a freeform box invites an operator to
 * type a reply that goes nowhere. Under ent#329 an answer can also spend a turn.
 * Acknowledge is the affordance that always terminates an item, which is what an
 * unrecognised one needs: a budgeted alert type whose items cannot be closed
 * jams its own pending cap permanently.
