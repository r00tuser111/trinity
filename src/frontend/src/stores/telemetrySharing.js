/**
 * Tier-2 opt-in fleet telemetry sharing (ent#12, extended by ent#437).
 *
 * The consent + status for the anonymized-aggregate sharing channel. Default-off,
 * reversible. All HTTP goes through the shared api.js client (Invariant #7).
 *
 * The `payload_preview` returned by GET is the EXACT anonymized aggregate that
 * would be sent — surfaced in the Settings panel and behind the consent card's
 * "See what would be sent" so the operator inspects what leaves the box before
 * consenting. Coarse counts only; never any PII.
 *
 * ent#437: TWO latches. `loaded` covers the status (share id, dismissal, the
 * last five sends); `previewLoaded` covers the aggregate itself, which the card
 * fetches lazily with `?preview=0` first. One latch would let the card's
 * preview-less load make the Settings panel show "(load to preview)" forever.
 * Every caller gates on admin BEFORE calling `load()`: the GET is admin + human
 * only and a non-admin call is a 403 the store would faithfully surface.
