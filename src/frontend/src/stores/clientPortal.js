// Authorization still sends the operator's — which is why #2258 rejected a
// "suppress the fallback" flag as dishonest: it hid the operator's roster on
// screen while the wire kept carrying the operator's credential.
//
// The interceptor DELETES whatever was inherited and then sets exactly what the

// decided with `onWorkspace && localStorage['token']`. Two things changed. Moving
// workspace calls onto `portalHttp` took them out of that interceptor's reach, so
// the operator bounce had to be re-established here or an operator whose JWT
// expired would sit on "Failed to load your agents" forever. And that predicate
// was already the wrong one: on the browser this issue is about, a CLIENT is
// signed in while `localStorage['token']` is an operator's — so one mistyped
// digit on the OTP form would 401 and throw the client onto /login while
// destroying the operator's session (the hazard `workspace-session-signout.md`
// lists as objection 3 to a suppression flag). `isPlatformSession` is the
// question actually being asked, and it answers false in exactly that case.

    // ACTIVATES the platform fallback — the reported bug.

    // A persisted "suppress the platform fallback" flag was the issue's own
    // suggestion and was rejected on evidence: `auth.js` installs the platform
    // JWT as an axios DEFAULT header, and per-request headers MERGE over
    // defaults, so a flag hides the operator's roster on screen while every
    // portal request still carries the operator's credential and the backend

    // handed). Destroying the credential is the one design where the wire and
    // the screen agree, and it needs no flag, no persistence, and leaves the
    // 401-bounce predicate (`localStorage['token']`) correct by construction.
    //
    // ORDER is load-bearing. The platform credential goes FIRST, so there is
    // no window in which `portalToken` is already gone while
    // `isAuthenticated` is still true — that is exactly the state in which
    // `authHeader` would hand an in-flight portal poll the operator's
    // identity. `signOut()` stays the plain state-clearing primitive:

    // never end a platform session (expiry is not a user act, and would take
    // an operator working in another tab with it).

    // EXPIRES on a browser which later gained a platform login still falls
    // back to that platform identity through `endSession` → `signOut`. It is

    // login to arrive AFTER the client signed in) and is tracked as #2261.

    // bug: on a fully entitled instance the rooms module answers "you cannot

    // uniform 404. Lowering on those turns one denied request into a
    // session-long false claim about the operator's build — and overwrites the

    // authored by different layers: a module that is SERVING answers with its
    // own structured `detail: {code, message}`, while absence is a plain string
    // — FastAPI's own "Not Found" when the route was never mounted, and the
    // entitlement gate's one-sentence 403 when it is mounted but unlicensed. A
    // coded detail therefore PROVES the substrate is present; treat it as an
    // ordinary refusal and let the caller surface the server's own words.

    // 404 (`load()` only reports on a full load), sending shows the generic
    // "That message was not delivered.", and the state never converges — the
    // gate is correct at load and the room is a dead end for the rest of the
    // session. With it, the poll lowers the flag, `<PortalRoom>` unmounts, and
    // the room route's honest refusal takes the stage. That is AC #4 holding
    // THROUGH a transition, and it is only safe because of the discriminator
