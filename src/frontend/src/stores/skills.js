/**
 * Skills domain store (#235).
 *
 * The skills machinery has shipped across three planes (#182 distribute/place/
 * expose, #183 package injection with a per-skill result contract), but nothing
 * rendered it: the Agent Detail Skills tab was hidden and assignment was
 * REST/MCP-only. This store backs the tab that makes it a product surface.
 *
 * Scope is distribute + place — browse the library, assign to an agent, and see
 * honestly what actually landed. Exposure curation (what an agent advertises
 * outward) is #178 and deliberately absent.
 *
 * All HTTP goes through the shared `api` client (Invariant #7). The panel this
 * replaces called `axios` directly with a hand-built auth header, which meant it
 * silently bypassed the interceptor every other call in the app relies on.
