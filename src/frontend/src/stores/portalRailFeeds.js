/**
 * The Workspace rail's feed store (trinity-enterprise#475): the canvases and
 * files of a chat's PARTICIPANTS, owned by the shell so the collapsed rail can
 * signal "updated since last view" with no tab body mounted.
 *
 * The shape is `stores/portalLoops.js`' — participant-scoped, identity-guarded
 * `setParticipants`, `allSettled` per participant so one agent's failure keeps
 * the others' data (ent#253 / #2382), a fetch token that drops a stale
 * response after a chat switch, and NO timer while idle. What differs:
 *
 *   * WHICH feeds are fetched is the shell's decision (`setFeeds`, read off
 *     `visibleTabs` through `feedsFor`) — the door gate extends from "mount"
 *     to "fetch", so a session that fails a tab's door never requests its data;
 *   * `uploads` (the viewer's own inbox) is read from the CONTAINER by the
 *     backend (`_read_inbox`, a docker exec) and is fetched only on request —
 *     while Files is the open active tab, after an upload from ANY surface
 *     (#2582, via `noteUpload`), and after a delete. It DOES signal since
 *     #2582: `portalRail.js::filesSignalItems` projects it onto the same
 *     `created_at` key the Files dot already reads, so the two collections stay
 *     separate and only the SIGNAL merges them;
 *   * push-driven refreshes are DEBOUNCED (trailing 2s): a 100-run loop emits
 *     100 `loop_run_completed` events, and each would otherwise cost every
 *     participant a canvas + documents round trip.
 *
 * Every request goes through the client-portal store's existing fetchers
 * (`portalHttp` + the portal auth header), so the roster gate and the
 * server-side audience / inbox narrowing are exactly the drawer's and the
 * agent page's.
