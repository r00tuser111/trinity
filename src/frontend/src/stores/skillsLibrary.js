 * Skills section (browse-only; assignment stays on each agent's Skills tab).

 * Deliberately SEPARATE from `stores/skills.js` (the per-agent Skills tab
 * store): App.vue wraps AgentDetail in KeepAlive, so SkillsPanel's
 * `onUnmounted → clear()` never fires on nav-away (deactivated ≠ unmounted).
 * Sharing `library`/`libraryStatus`/`loading`/`error` refs would let this
 * page's writes — including a failed fetch's error — render inside the CACHED
 * per-agent Skills tab (an agent suddenly "has no skills"). A separate store
 * removes that whole coupling class. This module imports NOTHING from
 * `stores/skills.js`; the ~40 duplicated lines of fetch logic are deliberate
 * (different lifecycle exposure, different semantics: fleet browse vs
 * agent-placement join).
