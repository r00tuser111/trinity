"""
Task Execution Service — Unified execution path for all task callers (EXEC-024).

Extracts execution orchestration from routers/chat.py into a shared service so
that all callers (authenticated tasks, public link chat, scheduled executions)
use a single code path for execution tracking, activity tracking, slot management,
and response processing.

Lifecycle:
    1. create execution record
    2. acquire capacity slot
    3. track activity start
    4. call agent (with retry)
    5. sanitize + persist result
    6. track activity completion
    7. release slot (finally)

# a full re-run of the user's turn on a fresh subscription — and it is bounded
# by the turn's REMAINING budget instead (see `_dispatch_with_retries`). It
# shared this constant until #2789, which killed every honest turn longer than
# five minutes that happened to hit a seat switch mid tool-use. Do not re-point

    """The #2391 producer gate: the overflow payload that lets THIS producer put
    a row on the durable queue, or ``None`` to keep today's ``"reject"`` policy.

    Until #2391 this producer dispatched with ``overflow_policy="reject"``
    unconditionally, so the scheduler's traffic — all cron, plus webhooks and
    reminders — could never be claimed by a pull worker no matter how
    ``PULL_MODE_PILOT_AGENTS`` was set (#2048 made that legible; it did not fix
    it). Returning a payload here flips the policy to ``"queue_persistent"`` for
    this one dispatch, which is what ``capacity_manager.acquire``'s pull branch
    needs to hand the row to ``BacklogService`` instead of admitting it.

    **The capacity-pressure decision (#2391 AC #1).** The gate is
    ``pull_owns_dispatch`` — the SAME predicate that already decides pull
    ownership — and nothing else. So:

      * flag OFF for this agent (every agent, by default): ``None`` → the policy
        stays ``"reject"`` and a fire arriving at capacity still fails fast with
        "Agent at capacity", byte-for-byte as before. **Scheduled dispatch
        semantics do not change for any agent that is not a pull pilot.** The
        alternative — giving this producer an unconditional persistent queue —
        would have changed the fleet's dominant traffic class under capacity
        pressure whether or not pull was enabled, which is precisely the risk
        #2048 declined to take.
      * flag ON: the row is never offered a slot at all (``acquire``'s
        ``pull_exclusive`` branch skips the ZADD), so "at capacity" stops being a
        state that can reject it. Capacity becomes physical — the agent's worker
        pool — which is #1081 Phase 5, pilot-scoped. Backpressure moves from
        reject-at-dispatch to ``agent_ownership.max_backlog_depth``: a full
        backlog still raises ``CapacityFull``, just at a deeper threshold and
        with ``reason="persistent_full"``.

    **Interaction with #1083 fire-and-forget (AC #4).** Both mechanisms exist to
    let a turn outlive the request, and they must not stack. Pull wins by
    construction, not by precedence: a pull-queued row is never dispatched, so
    there is no HTTP call for the agent to ACK with 202 and ``async_result`` is
    never sent. ``dispatch_async_eligible`` is still evaluated in
    ``execute_task`` but its result is unreachable once this returns a payload.
    The two share the machinery that matters anyway — the eid-keyed slot lease,
    the lease reaper, and the ``claim_token``-gated CAS terminal write — so the
    recovery story is single, not layered.

    Two hard preconditions, both about not corrupting state we do not own:

      * ``execution_id`` must exist — ``BacklogService.enqueue`` transitions an
        EXISTING row RUNNING→QUEUED under a CAS; with no row there is nothing to
        transition.
      * ``slot_already_held`` must be False — the caller (a drain, or the /task
        router's pre-flight) owns a real slot and releases it in our ``finally``.
        Queueing under a held slot would leak it for the lease TTL.

    Never raises: ``pull_owns_dispatch`` already fails safe to push, and the
    request build is pure construction. The dangerous direction is queueing work
    that should have been pushed.

    The sync edge adapter #1081 Phase 4 asks for, in its smallest useful form.
    On the push path this is exactly ``execute_task`` — the turn runs inside the
    await and the result is the result. Under pull the dispatch returns
    ``QUEUED`` the moment the row is on the durable queue and the turn runs later
    in the agent's worker, so this waits for that row's terminal
    (``sync_waiter.wait_for_sync_terminal``) and rebuilds the result from it.

    That is the whole reason a trigger like ``a2a`` was stranded: its caller
    consumes ``result.response`` to build a JSON-RPC artifact, and a queued
    dispatch gave it nothing. It does not need a receipt to poll — it needs to
    block correctly while the work happens somewhere else, which is a different
    thing and one the adapter already does.

    ⚠️ Under pull, nothing signals the waiter directly (the pull sink writes the
    terminal through the CAS, it does not know about this registry), so the wake
    comes from ``sync_waiter``'s DB-poll fallback and latency is bounded by
    ``SYNC_WAITER_POLL_INTERVAL``. For a turn measured in seconds-to-minutes that
    is noise, and it is deliberately not worth a second signalling path.

    A wait that times out returns a FAILED result with ``TIMEOUT`` rather than
    raising — the execution keeps running and its real terminal still lands on

        side effect — completing the activity, recording the dispatch-breaker
        outcome, and releasing the capacity slot — runs ONLY when this writer won
        the CAS. A CAS-lost write (a replayed/late callback, or a turn superseded
        by a cancel/reaper) does nothing: no double activity close, no breaker
        churn, and critically no double slot release (``slot_service.release_slot``
        fires the BACKLOG-001 drain regardless of ZREM, so a replayed release
        would over-admit past ``max_parallel_tasks``).

        ``finally`` releases unconditionally — the coroutine owns the slot for the
        whole turn). Gating release on the CAS bool is what makes a duplicate
        callback safe.

        The two terminal styles differ on a lost CAS, preserving #671/H4:
        - SUCCESS (success-style): on lost CAS, reconcile to the persisted
          terminal — complete the activity FAILED ("superseded by …") and return
