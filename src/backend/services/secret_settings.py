"""
Credential-bearing ``system_settings`` keys: encrypt at rest (trinity-enterprise#435).

Six settings rows held **live third-party credentials in cleartext**
(``anthropic_api_key``, ``github_pat``, ``google_api_key``, ``slack_app_token``,
``slack_client_secret``, ``slack_signing_secret``) while their siblings —
``elevenlabs_api_key_encrypted`` (ent#117), ``a2a_outbound_endpoints_encrypted``
(#736) and every AES-256-GCM token *column* under Invariant #12 — encrypted.
The platform's encryption-at-rest posture was therefore only partially true and
a single ``SELECT`` contradicted any statement of it (CWE-312).

This module is the **policy leaf** for that class: which keys are secret, what
the envelope looks like, and the sink guard that stops a new cleartext write.
It is deliberately dependency-light — ``db``/``services`` imports are lazy and
local — because ``db/settings.py`` calls into it and the reverse edge would
invert Invariant #1's layering.

Three properties are load-bearing:

1. **The key NAME moves, not just the value.** The encrypted form lives under a
   distinct ``<key>_encrypted`` row and the legacy row is DELETED. A same-named
   key that may hold either cleartext or an envelope leaves "is this install
   encrypted?" unanswerable by inspection — which is the reported defect, not a
   cosmetic detail. With the rename, the issue's own verification query
   (``SELECT key FROM system_settings WHERE key IN (...)`` returning nothing)
   *is* the proof, and it stays true forever because the guard below refuses to
   recreate the legacy row.

2. **The read path lazily migrates.** A migration converts what is on disk once,
   but the legacy row can come back — an operator restoring a pre-fix backup, a
   rollback-then-roll-forward, a direct DB write. ``resolve_secret_setting``
   therefore encrypts-and-deletes whatever legacy row it finds, so cleartext is
   transient rather than permanent no matter how it arrived. Steady state pays
   nothing: when the encrypted row is present the legacy key is never read.

3. **The guard is an explicit set PLUS a shape heuristic.** The explicit set is
   precise and refuses with a pointer to the encrypted route. The heuristic
   catches the *next* credential-shaped key somebody invents — including through
   the generic ``PUT /api/settings/{key}`` catch-all, which is how five previous
   settings-hardening issues (#506, #1609, ent#12, #1644, ent#14, ent#346) each
   found the same door standing open. Unknown-but-credential-shaped is refused,
   not silently stored; reviewed non-secrets are named in
   ``PUBLIC_CREDENTIAL_SHAPED_KEYS`` with a reason.
