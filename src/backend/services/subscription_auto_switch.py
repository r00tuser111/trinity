"""
Subscription Auto-Switch Service (SUB-003).

Automatically switches an agent to a different subscription on the first
subscription failure — either a rate-limit (429) or an auth-class error
(401/403/credit balance/expired token, etc.).

Preconditions (all must be true):
1. Setting "auto_switch_subscriptions" is enabled (default: on, opt-out)
2. Agent has a subscription assigned (not API key)
3. At least one rate-limit / auth event recorded for this (agent, subscription)
4. At least one alternative subscription is available, not rate-limited, and
   (#2409) not currently refused by the provider — the survivors are ranked
   by cached headroom, furthest from the nearest wall first

Threshold note (#441): pre-#441 we required 2+ consecutive 429s before
switching. That guaranteed at least one user-visible failure on long-running
schedules and never fired on auth-class breakage at all. The 2h skip-list on
alternative selection (`select_best_alternative_subscription` +
`has_recent_subscription_failures` — kind-BLIND, and renamed from
`is_subscription_rate_limited` by #2352 precisely so this caller keeps counting
auth failures while the display surfaces stopped calling them rate limits) is
what prevents thrashing — see
`tests/unit/test_subscription_auto_switch_pingpong.py` for the regression
tests pinning that contract.

    this is exactly the shape #447 exists to replace, and it makes the two

    is demonstrably serving, while this would keep evacuating agents off it on
    every dispatch — a hot-reload and a high-priority notification per turn, and
    with two such subscriptions, a flap turn after turn. The db predicate is an
    inference from past failures; a probe is ground truth about now, so it wins

    via ``POST /api/credentials/reload-token`` (#1089).

    The agent server mutates its own ``os.environ["CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN"]``,
    so the NEXT claude subprocess uses the rotated token while in-flight turns
    keep their already-inherited old token and finish — "rotate a credential"
    is no longer the same operation as "kill every running turn".

    Falls back to the full ``_restart_agent`` recreate path (today's behavior,
    no regression) on:
      - a 404 — an old base image that predates the endpoint,
      - any transport / circuit failure (``AgentClientError`` family), or
      - no resolvable token for the agent's current subscription.
    Returns ``"no_container"`` / ``"not_running"`` when the agent is not a
    running container, mirroring ``_restart_agent``.

    Invariant every caller relies on (#2114): a call here implies the agent is
    subscription-backed AT SEND TIME — structurally enforced, not conventional:
    all three producers (auto-switch, manual sub→sub reassignment, key-rollover
    fan-out) are sub→sub by construction (auth-MODE changes recreate instead),
    and this helper re-resolves the subscription from the DB below, falling
    back to restart when no token resolves. That is what makes
    ``remove_api_key=True`` safe: a subscription-backed Claude agent never has
    a legitimate ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` at spawn, and post-#1999 the `.env`
    file is a second source for it that no recreate ever cleans — a stale key
    there shadows every spawn (Claude Code prefers the key over the OAuth
    token). Non-Claude runtimes keep ``False``: a legacy subscription row on a
    Gemini/Codex agent must not strip a `.env` key its own scripts may use.
