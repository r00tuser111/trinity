    """Single owner of the GitHub-sync env block across BOTH rebuild paths.

    Before ent#109 this block existed only in `_apply_persisted_auth_env`
    (`recreate_missing_container`, the rebuild-from-nothing path).
    `recreate_container_with_updated_config` — whose production callers are
    `start_agent_internal`, fired by nine config-drift predicates **and by
    base-image drift at cold start**, and (ent#109) `repo_binding`'s bind path,
    which calls it directly and therefore owes the same `clear_agent_breakers`
    that `start_agent_internal` runs immediately before its own call — seeded
    env from the OLD container and
    re-derived only `GITHUB_PAT`. So a fleet-wide base-image rebuild replayed
    whatever git env each container happened to be carrying.

    **The gate is the REPO, not the PAT** (ent#123). A tokenless agent (an
    anonymous public-template clone, e.g. Cornelius) must still receive
    `GITHUB_REPO` + `GIT_SYNC_ENABLED`, or startup.sh never attempts the clone
    and the rebuild yields a silently empty agent reporting green health — the
    #843/#1439 class.

    **Correct, never introduce — on the config-drift path only.** Because the
    repo half is repo-gated and the PAT half keeps #211's narrower per-agent
    gate, the two disagree for a real row shape (`POST /{agent}/git/initialize`
    on the global platform PAT), and introducing `GIT_SYNC_ENABLED=true` with
    no `GITHUB_PAT` makes startup.sh scrub that agent's only credential and
    blackhole its push remote. So `per_agent_only` writes the block only when
    the old container already carried a `GITHUB_REPO` (or a PAT resolves) —
    correcting a stale repo, a flipped `source_mode` or a deleted row, which is
    every case this fix is about. `effective` is exempt: with no old container,
    not introducing the block IS the #843/#1439 bug. See the inline note.

    ``pat_gate`` — **never inherited, always stated by the call site.** The two
    paths gate the PAT differently on purpose and a shared default would be a
    credential leak:

    ``"per_agent_only"`` (config-drift recreate)
        `#211`'s opt-in guard, verbatim: resolve the effective PAT only when
        the container **already carries** one, or a **per-agent** PAT row
        exists. A global-only platform PAT is therefore never injected into a
        previously-tokenless container. Without this, `configure_push_remote`
        (startup.sh) would clear the push blackhole on the next recreate and a
        tokenless agent could push a private workspace to a shared public
        upstream (`learnings.md` ent#162).

    ``"effective"`` (rebuild-from-nothing)
        The 2-tier per-agent → global resolution this path has always used.
        There is no old container to inherit a token from, so a rebuild needs
        *something*; the row's own existence is the opt-in.

    Set-or-clear, with one deliberate asymmetry. Both callers write into a dict
    that may carry values forward (`recreate_container_with_updated_config`
    seeds from the old container), so every repo-derived var is cleared when it
    no longer applies — a deleted `agent_git_config` row (reachable from the
    `routers/git.py` orphan cleanup and `_rollback_failed_creation`) pops the
    whole set, and a `source_mode` flip clears the mode/branch pair.
    ``GITHUB_PAT`` alone is **set-only while a repo is bound**: clearing it
    would revoke a live agent's push on an unrelated recreate, which is not
    this change's business.

    Named behaviour change (the only divergence from a verbatim lift): a
    container with a baked `GITHUB_PAT` and **no git binding** previously had
    that token refreshed *from the global platform PAT* on every recreate; it
    is now popped instead. The per-agent PAT is a column on `agent_git_config`,
    so "no row" means "no per-agent credential and nothing to push to" by
    construction. The population is transient (an aborted create, or an
    orphan-cleanup window), and popping runs in the same direction as ent#162.

    **Reads DB state; writes none.** `GIT_SYNC_AUTO` is derived as
    `DB flag OR baked env` and the disagreement is only logged — see the inline
    note for why a write-back cannot distinguish a creation-time discrepancy
    from an owner's explicit disable.

    Recreate an agent container with updated configuration.
    Handles shared folder mounts and API key settings.
    Preserves the agent's workspace volume and other configuration.

    **This function STARTS the replacement container.** That was true before
    #2092 too, but only the call sites knew it: each in-tree caller pre-checked
    `container.status == "running"` and refused otherwise, while this function
    captured no run state, offered no way to preserve it, and said nothing about
    the precondition — which documented `env_overrides` at length.

    Recreating a deliberately-stopped agent therefore started it, silently and
    with no log line saying the run state had changed. Out-of-tree ops tooling
    doing a base-image adoption wave hit exactly that: two agents stopped eight
    days earlier came back up. Note what did NOT contain it — `autonomy_enabled
    = 0` gates cron fires and reminders (#1806) but not human-initiated inbound
    chat, so a channel binding and a public link became reachable again. No
    traffic arrived; the containment was luck.

    Args:
        require_running: refuse (ValueError) unless ``old_container`` is
            running. Default True, which is what every existing caller already
            enforces for itself — so this changes no behaviour and converts the
            silent start into a loud error for the next caller. Pass False to
            recreate a stopped agent deliberately.
        preserve_run_state: leave the replacement STOPPED when the original was
            stopped. What a base-image adoption wave actually wants, and awkward
            to do from outside: the caller would have to read the state before,
            then stop the container after it is already up and its agent server
            has begun booting — racing its own recreate. Here the stop is issued
            immediately after the handoff. The replacement is still created via
            ``containers_run`` and so boots briefly before being stopped; that is
            visible in the container's log, and is the honest cost of not
            duplicating the (heavily conditioned) creation call.

        env_overrides: #1854 — env vars to force onto the replacement,
            applied LAST (immediately before the container handoff), so they win
            over every derived rule in between. The caller owns the value; this
            function neither mints nor validates it.

            Used by MCP-key rotation and by the start-time drift self-heal, both
            of which must bake a freshly minted `TRINITY_MCP_API_KEY` that
            cannot be reconstructed from persisted state (only the hash is
            stored). NOT applied at the `Config.Env` copy point: roughly twenty
            derived mutations sit between there and the handoff (subscription
            token/API-key juggling, GitHub PAT, guardrails, stall limit,
            TRINITY_AGENT_AUTH_TOKEN, the pull-mode pop+update), and an override
            landing before them would be silently clobbered by any that happened
            to collide.
        full_capabilities: #1816 override for the fleet-wide capabilities
            setting. ``None`` (every existing caller) resolves it the same way
            the matching predicate does — the fleet default for a regular
            agent, and unconditionally ``True`` for ``trinity-system``, whose
            FULL_CAPABILITIES are contractual (package installation), not
            fleet-derived. Writer and checker route through the SAME
            ``is_system_agent_name`` helper so they cannot disagree; if they
            did, the checker would keep demanding a recreate the writer never
            satisfies (infinite recreate loop — the hazard this module already

    Soft delete removes the container but keeps the `agent-<name>-workspace`
    volume and every relational row. Recovery clears `deleted_at` but nothing
    could bring the agent back online: `start` 404'd (no container) and
    `recreate_container_with_updated_config` needs an `old_container` to copy
    config from. This reconstructs the container spec from persisted state
    (`agent_ownership` + `agent_git_config` + the volume's `template.yaml`),
    reuses the existing volume (never recreated — no data loss), and runs it
    through the same `_provision_folders_and_run_agent_container` tail as a
    normal recreate, so the full security posture (cap-drop, no-new-privileges
    via AppArmor+cap model, noexec tmpfs, derived TRINITY_AGENT_AUTH_TOKEN) is
    identical. startup.sh sees `.git` already on the volume and skips the clone.

    Caller must confirm a live `agent_ownership` row exists first — this does
    NOT create ownership/child rows, only the container.

    Refuses `trinity-system` (#1816): this path reconstructs a REGULAR agent and
    cannot reproduce the orchestrator's contract — it mints a fresh
    *agent-scoped* MCP key after deactivating the existing **system-scoped** one
    (whose plaintext is unrecoverable, so the downgrade is irreversible), omits
    the `trinity.is-system` label and the read-only `/template` bind, arms
    `TRINITY_BACKEND_URL` (the scope-403 heartbeat loop #1816 exists to avoid),
    and follows the fleet capabilities setting instead of the contractual one.
    (#2541 removed one item from that list: the rebuild no longer drops
    `restart_policy: unless-stopped` — it goes through the shared tail, which
    now bakes it unconditionally. Every other reason stands, so the fence does
    not move.) #1816 made this reachable from the
    boot path and from `POST /api/system-agent/restart` (both now delegate to

    the container lookup mid-flight. Failing closed is safe and self-healing:
