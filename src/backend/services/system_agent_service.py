#
# Honest about its reach: `ensure_deployed` is called ONCE per backend process
# (main.py's lifespan), and this cursor is per-process, so with `--workers N`
# a stale boot files N items — one per worker — and a restart loop files N per
# restart. That is deliberate rather than overlooked: a cross-worker cursor
# means Redis or a DB read on the boot path for an ADVISORY alarm, and the
# established idiom (sync_failing / git_bloat) keeps the id un-guessable
# (`{prefix}{agent}-{utc_now_iso()}`) precisely so it cannot be pre-created and
# silenced — which a deterministic, dedupable id would give up. Operator-queue
# retention and Clear All bound the rest.

# reports is one a crash-looping backend re-hits on a FRESH process every time,
# so the cursor resets before it can suppress anything — and the standing case
# (a missing `trinity-agent-network`, which the pre-flight detects) repeats on
# every boot of every worker, while retention never deletes a `pending` row.
#
# Bounded in the DB instead, by bucketing the item id: `create_item`'s
# `on_conflict_do_nothing(agent_name, request_id)` collapses every emission
# inside a bucket to one row, across workers AND across restarts.
#
# Deliberately a BUCKET, not a fixed id. A fixed id would wedge the alarm shut
# forever the first time the row reached a terminal state — Clear All sets
# `cancelled`, and the conflict target does not care about status (#1644's
# lesson: a load-bearing queue item is the wrong place to keep state). The
# bucket re-arms on its own.
#
# Safe to make guessable ONLY because BASE_IMAGE_STALE_ALERT_PREFIX is
# registered in operator_queue_service._RESERVED_ID_PREFIXES (#1632): an agent
# that tried to pre-create the row — and so silence the alarm raised about it —

        Follows the established `sync_failing` / `git_bloat` idiom in
        `sync_health_service`: an un-guessable timestamped id under a
        platform-RESERVED prefix (#1632 — otherwise an agent could pre-create
        the row and, via create_item's on_conflict_do_nothing, silence the
        alarm raised about it), `priority: high`, and emit-failure-safe.

        This is what actually delivers AC1 on the canonical upgrade path.
        `build-base-image.sh` only builds and tags, `start.sh`/`stop.sh` never
        touch agent containers, `restart_fleet` skips system agents, and the
        container carries `restart_policy: unless-stopped` — so after a
        canonical upgrade the system agent is RUNNING, which is precisely the
        branch that must not act. Without an alarm the platform would notice the
        staleness and tell no one.

        Raised on `stale` ONLY. Never on `unknown`: a fail-open probe must not
        manufacture an alert.

        The payload carries the agent name and an instruction — never image ids
        or digests (canary G-04's lesson: this row is durable and
