"""The single source of truth for the selectable Claude-model catalog (#2086).

Before #2086 the same catalog was hand-maintained in three independent places
with no shared registry, so the copies drifted silently (the #1660 / #1662 class:
a shipping model missing from one list). The worst drift was asymmetric —
``PUBLIC_CHANNEL_MODELS`` is a *validation* set, so a model absent there is
rejected **422** on ``PUT /api/agents/{name}/public-channel-model`` (an owner
cannot select it even via the API), while the two frontend lists degraded quietly
(free-text still saved).

This module is now the ONE place the catalog is defined. Every consumer derives
its view by filtering:

  * ``PUBLIC_CHANNEL_MODELS`` (below) — the #894 server-validated allow-list for
    the per-agent public-channel override. ``settings_service`` re-exports it.
  * ``src/frontend/src/constants/modelCatalog.js`` — a GENERATED, checked-in JS
    mirror (do NOT edit it by hand; run ``python scripts/gen_model_catalog.py``).
    The ModelSelector picker derives ``PRESET_MODELS`` from it; the admin
    default-model dropdown filters it on ``adminDefaultSelectable``.

A ``tests/unit/`` guard (``test_2086_model_catalog_parity.py``) byte-matches the
committed JS against ``render_js()`` **and** structurally validates the parsed
records against this source, so a consumer edited without re-running codegen —
or a wrong-but-fresh ``render_js()`` — fails CI on every PR.

WHAT THE GUARD DOES NOT CATCH — the human control (#2086)
--------------------------------------------------------
The guard catches consumer-vs-source divergence. It does NOT catch
source-vs-reality staleness: when Anthropic ships a new model and nobody edits
this file, every list stays consistent and green while the new model is
unselectable everywhere (the exact bug class that created #2086). The control for
that is human, and it is a single-file edit:

    >>> When Anthropic ships a selectable Claude model, add one ModelEntry to
    >>> MODEL_CATALOG below and re-run ``python scripts/gen_model_catalog.py``.

That is the whole maintenance surface — one file, one script.

DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE
-------------------------
* ``settings_service.PLATFORM_DEFAULT_MODEL_VALUE`` (#831) — the *actual* fleet
  default is a cost/latency POLICY choice, not catalog data. The ``recommended``
  flag below is pinned to it (the guard asserts they agree), but this module
  never decides the default.
* ``services/model_context.py`` (#1521) — the context-window map is prefix-based
  and vendored byte-identically into the agent image under Invariant #5. It is a
  separate registry; folding it in here would break the vendoring contract.

Stdlib-only leaf (Eng #5/#7): imports nothing from ``settings_service`` or
``database`` (both trigger ``init_database()`` at import), so the codegen script
and the parity test load it with zero DB dependency. Dependency direction is
one-way — ``settings_service`` imports this, never the reverse.

    """One selectable model and its policy dimensions.

    * ``public_channel`` — selectable as the #894 per-agent public-channel
      override (the ``PUBLIC_CHANNEL_MODELS`` validation set).
    * ``admin_default_selectable`` — offered in the admin fleet-default dropdown.
      Named to avoid colliding with ``PLATFORM_DEFAULT_MODEL_VALUE`` (which means
      the *actual* default). Haiku is deliberately public but NOT default-selectable
      (#1080: an admin must not be able to default the whole fleet to the cheap tier).
    * ``recommended`` — drives the admin dropdown's "(recommended)" marker. Exactly
      one entry carries it, and it is pinned to ``PLATFORM_DEFAULT_MODEL_VALUE``.
    * ``workspace`` / ``workspace_tier`` (ent#403) — offered in the **Workspace
      composer's** client-facing dropdown, and the plain-language primary text
      that option renders. A separate dimension rather than a reuse of ``note``,
      which is copy written for the operator picker: joining ``label — note``
      yields two options both leading with "Most capable", and one em-dash nested
      inside another. Same precedent as ``admin_default_selectable`` vs
      ``recommended`` — a new policy dimension on the same source, never a second
      hand-typed list.

    ⚠️ **This is a positional frozen dataclass** — every entry below passes its
    booleans positionally. A field inserted anywhere but LAST silently reassigns
    ``public_channel`` / ``admin_default_selectable`` / ``recommended`` on every
    entry, with no error. Append; set the new ones by keyword.

# rule the agent runtime already applies to its own `PUT /api/model`
# (docker/base-image/agent_server/routers/chat.py: a short alias, or a
# vendor-prefixed id), lifted to the request boundary. Until #2796 the operator
# routes applied it NOWHERE, so `model="admin"` travelled from the request body

# output — a total failure whose message names no field.
#
# Why not the closed set used for the Workspace: that set is 3 of the 11 ids in
# this file, and the operator picker documents free-text passthrough (see
# _GENERATED_HEADER below and ModelSelector.vue) — the `[1m]` extended-context
# suffix and any newly-shipped id must keep working without a catalog bump.
# A closed set here would refuse ids this very file ships. The shape gate keeps
# that open door while still refusing a value that cannot name a model, and it
# closes argv smuggling in passing: a leading `-` matches no family.
#
# The families are MIRRORED from `services/model_context.py`'s
# `_FAMILY_PREFIX_WINDOWS`, which is already the platform's answer to "is this id
# one we recognise?" — a miss there logs `unrecognized model id`. Mirrored and
# not imported, for two reasons the codebase already states: `model_context` is
# vendored byte-identically into the agent image (Invariant #5), and this module
# is a stdlib-only leaf whose docstring keeps that registry deliberately out of
# scope. Drift is a build failure, not a silent divergence —
# `test_2796_gate_covers_every_family_model_context_knows` asserts the two agree,
# so a newly supported runtime is one edit here away from being dispatchable.
#
# Matching follows `model_context`: case-folded, prefix (not exact), so
# `gpt-5.1-codex`, `claude-sonnet-4-6[1m]` and a bare `sonnet` all pass.
