# ============================================================================
# #2572 — credential-less agents adopt an available subscription
# ============================================================================
#
# The gap this closes sits BETWEEN two features that each behave as written:
# SUB-003 (``subscription_auto_switch``) only ever moves an agent that already
# HAS a subscription (its precondition 2 — "not api key"), and registering a
# subscription assigned no agent at all. So on an instance with no
# ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` — the default for an unattended / marketplace install —
# every pre-existing agent sat in ``api_key`` mode with nothing behind it, and
# the one action the product tells the operator to take changed nothing.
#
# THREE triggers, and deliberately no periodic sweep (the operator's decision,
# 2026-09-12):
#   A1  ``POST /api/subscriptions``                     — routers/subscriptions.py
#   A2  the two Anthropic-key clear paths               — routers/settings.py
#   B   agent creation — ALREADY shipped by #74 (``crud._apply_subscription_env``),
#       which gates only on ``is_claude_runtime`` and so already covers a keyless
#       instance. Pinned by test, not re-implemented here.
#
# SUB-003's precondition is NOT relaxed: this is a second, event-driven trigger,
# not a change to failure-driven switching.
#
# The cardinal rule the issue makes non-negotiable — "agents with a working API
# key are unaffected, silently migrating them would move real spend onto
# someone's personal plan" — is guaranteed STRUCTURALLY by condition 1 below:
# the sweep short-circuits to "adopt nobody" whenever the platform can resolve
# an Anthropic key at all.

#: Above this many adoptions in one sweep, log a WARNING with the elapsed time.
#: Deliberately a warning and NOT a cap — a cap bounds the blast radius but
#: silently strands the remainder, and (no periodic sweep) nothing would come
#: back for them.

    freshly-assigned agent fails ``check_api_key_env_matches``, so
    ``start_agent_internal`` re-bakes its auth block from the DB on its next
    start — but nothing on the dispatch path calls ``start_agent_internal``, so
    a RUNNING agent has no "next start", and the operator declined a periodic
