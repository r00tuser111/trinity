Settings service for retrieving configuration values.

- Environment variable fallbacks
- Typed conversions

This service breaks the circular dependency where services were importing

        `https-ip` vs `https-domain` is the distinction that matters to the

        unmemorable. It is a working posture to be upgraded, not a broken one.
