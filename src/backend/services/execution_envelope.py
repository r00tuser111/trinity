"""Execution result vocabulary (#2314).

The three types every producer and consumer of an execution terminal shares:
the machine-readable error code, the result a caller receives, and the
normalized envelope ``apply_result`` finalizes from.

Carved out of ``task_execution_service`` because they are the one part of that
module with **no collaborators at all** — pure dataclasses and an enum, no
``db``, no HTTP, no capacity manager. That makes this module importable from
anywhere without an import cycle, which is what lets the phase modules beside
it name the same vocabulary instead of importing the service they belong to.

Re-exported from ``services.task_execution_service`` so every existing
``from services.task_execution_service import TaskExecutionResult`` keeps
working unchanged.

    (#1083).

    The single input shape for finalizing an execution, whether the terminal is
    produced inline (sync path) or arrives over the result-callback endpoint.
    ``apply_result`` derives every persisted field (cost rollup, context, tool
    calls, compact metadata, salvage) from these raw-ish inputs — it never
    re-runs the error classifier, so ``error_code`` MUST already be set by the
    producer (the substring/status classification stays in ``execute_task``).

    Fields:
        status: ``TaskExecutionStatus.SUCCESS`` or ``.FAILED`` — selects the
            success-style (reconcile-on-lost-CAS) vs failure-style applier.
        response: raw response text (success). Sanitized inside ``apply_result``.
        error: failure message (failure).
        error_code: pre-classified ``TaskExecutionErrorCode`` — only ``AUTH``
            feeds the dispatch breaker (D10).
        metadata: raw agent metadata dict (cost_usd, context_window, tokens,
            compact_events, session_id). Sanitized for the salvage path.
        execution_log: raw transcript list (success) or None.
        session_id: raw ``response_data['session_id']`` (may be None — the
            persisted ``claude_session_id`` falls back to ``metadata['session_id']``).
        retry_count: #678 in-line retry count for the terminal write.
        previous_attempt_cost: #678 R2 — failed-first-attempt cost rolled into
            the terminal cost write.
        execution_time_ms: wall-clock used for the activity-completion detail.
        raw_response: full response dict threaded back via ``TaskExecutionResult``
            (Session router consumes ``compact_events``); empty for callbacks.
