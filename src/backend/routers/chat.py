    #      the ownership gate below would pass it — but resuming it runs
    #      `--resume dispatched_async`, which cannot resolve. Reject up front.
    #   2. Authorize ownership — execution rows are AGENT-scoped
    #      (accessible_agent_names), but claude_session_id is a per-user secret
    #      (routers/sessions.py gates the Session tab on it and 404s to avoid leaking
    #      its existence). Without this check, any operator on a *shared* agent could
    #      read a peer's session id from the executions list and resume their private
    #      conversation (IDOR). 404 (not 403) mirrors that enumeration-safe response.

    # The gate is keyed ONLY on resume_session_id being present — deliberately NOT
    # `and not x_source_agent`. x_source_agent is a raw client header; a regular user
    # (current_user.agent_name is None, so the SELF-EXEC-001 spoof-guard below never
    # fires for them) could otherwise set it to skip the gate entirely and keep the
