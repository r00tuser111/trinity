# mcp: none — platform admin settings — a grant surface, human-only (Invariant #8 grant-vs-use)
"""System settings routes for the Trinity backend.

Endpoints for system-wide configuration. Admin-only for modification, read
access for all authenticated users.

#1028: this was one 3,529-line module — the largest file in the backend and
more than four times the 800-line critical threshold. It is now a package of
eleven domain modules composed onto **one** router here, so the mounted API is
byte-identical to the single-module version and `from routers.settings import
router` is unchanged.

**Inclusion order is load-bearing, not cosmetic** (Invariant #4). `generic`
owns `GET/PUT/DELETE /{key}`, which matches any single path segment. Included
before its siblings it would swallow `/ops/config`, `/brain-orb`,
`/api-keys/anthropic` and every other specific route, answering "setting not
found" for routes that plainly exist — a failure that no unit test of an
individual handler can see, because each handler still works when called
directly. `tests/unit/test_1028_settings_package.py` pins the ordering.
