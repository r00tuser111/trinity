"""The generic `/{key}` catch-all, and the blocklist that keeps validated keys off it.

Carved out of the 3,529-line `routers/settings.py` (#1028). The package
`__init__` composes every sub-router onto one `/api/settings` router, so the
mounted API is byte-identical to the single-module version.

**Registered LAST, and that ordering is load-bearing** (Invariant #4).
`/{key}` matches any single segment, so every specific route — `/ops/config`,
`/brain-orb`, `/api-keys/anthropic` — must be included before it or the
catch-all swallows them and answers 'setting not found' for a route that exists.
