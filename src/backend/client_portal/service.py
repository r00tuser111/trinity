"""Business logic for the enterprise client-portal exposure config (#79). Private.

Owns the portal base-URL seam: ``get_portal_base_url()`` is the single resolver
every portal URL the platform generates (portal links, signed file-download URLs)
must go through, so a private (VPN/LAN) deployment never emits a public URL and a
public one never emits a private URL. Default is today's public behavior: an
explicit ``portal_base_url`` override wins, otherwise it falls back to the OSS
``public_chat_url`` (settings row → ``PUBLIC_CHAT_URL`` env).

``exposure_mode`` records the operator's intent (public tunnel vs private
VPN/LAN). In this first slice it is advisory config + the resolver; it will later
drive CORS / cookie-``Secure`` policy for non-public origins and the deployment
guide. Actual routing to tunnel vs VPN is deployment topology, not code.

Self-contained: reads the OSS ``public_chat_url`` row directly (mirroring
``settings_service.get_public_chat_url``) rather than importing the heavy
``services.settings_service`` facade, so the module stays isolated-testable.

    page. It is deliberately NOT the default — an external client's roster must
    stay exactly what was shared with them, and a bug that flipped this on for
    a portal-token session would show a client agents they were never given.

    Identity is the caller's verified email (not a users row — the line epic #78

    the browser resolves them against whatever base it loaded the portal from.

    Every card therefore ships ``briefing_state="pending"`` with the briefing
    fields at their defaults; the client hydrates them through ``get_briefings``
    (``GET /briefings``) off the critical path. A headless ent#83 consumer that

    says nothing about whether the agent answers HTTP. A stopped or absent

    Live agent data from ``/api/template/info`` — the template ``description``
    plus the ent#380 hint ladder: the client-visible playbooks (the operator's
    connector allow-list ∩ ``user_invocable``, from ``/api/skills``), falling
    back to the template-declared ``use_cases`` ("What You Can Ask") when no
    playbook is exposed. The curated exposable-skills config (ent#178) slots
    into this same seam once it exists. A failure the agent itself answered for
    (a 500 on one leg, no connector config, nothing exposed) yields empty fields
    so the caller stays fast and never errors.

    **Reachability is reported separately from content (#2163).** An exit that
    never got an answer out of the agent — the availability skip, both GETs
    failing at the transport layer (`ConnectError`, `ReadTimeout`, anything
    else `client.get` can raise), or a failure before the first request —
    returns the ``_UNREACHED`` sentinel instead of a fresh empty briefing, so
    ``_bounded_briefing`` can tell "the agent said it has no hints" from "the
    agent said nothing at all". ONE leg answering is enough to count as reached:
    the client renders ``unavailable`` INSTEAD of the fields, so a half-answered
    briefing that still carries a description must not throw it away.

    #2196: this used to make its OWN ``get_agent_container()`` call per card and
    throw the answer away, collapsing "no container" / "stopped" / "HTTP failed"
    into one ``(None, [])``. The caller now resolves that state once — for the
    whole roster in a single Docker call — and hands it in, so the enrichment
    costs N HTTP calls instead of N inspects + N HTTP calls, and the answer is
    used rather than discarded.

    ``availability`` defaults to ``"ready"`` — "the caller asserts this agent can
    run" — which is the honest contract for a direct call and keeps the existing
    one-argument call sites and stubs working.

    ``unknown`` is ATTEMPTED, not skipped, and the asymmetry with the turn gate
    is deliberate rather than an oversight: this function reaches the agent at
    ``http://agent-{name}:8000`` **by DNS over the agent network**, so a backend
    Docker-socket fault — the exact class this design is built around — says
    nothing about whether the agent answers HTTP. Skipping on ``unknown`` would
    turn one unreadable socket into "no briefings fleet-wide" while every
    briefing would in fact have worked.

    about the same agent. Never raises: a trip, a raise, an agent that was never
    attempted, or an agent that could not be REACHED all yield
    `(AgentBriefing(), False)`, and `ok` is what the caller stamps as

    `ok=True` does NOT mean "we got data": `_agent_briefing` swallows the
    failures the agent itself answered for, and an agent with nothing exposed
    legitimately returns empty fields. It means THE AGENT ANSWERED, inside the
    budget — which is exactly the distinction the client needs to decide whether
    retrying could change anything.

    That second half is why `_UNREACHED` is checked here (#2163): the verdict
    must depend on whether the agent was reachable, never on which door the
    failure exited by. Before it, a `ReadTimeout` and a `ConnectError` both
    returned an ordinary empty briefing inside the budget and this function
    truthfully — and uselessly — reported `ok=True`.

    ``requested`` (the user's explicit pick, already validated at the router)
    → the agent's #894 ``public_channel_model`` → the PLATFORM DEFAULT. The
    ladder resolves to a concrete id and only degrades to ``None`` when the
    platform default itself is unreadable.

    Three states on the WIRE, one value on the row. ``None`` in
    ``PortalChatRequest.model`` still means INHERIT — the shape the #894
    plumbing uses (``routers/agent_config.py`` writes ``None`` for "unset") —
    but the ladder's job is to say what the turn will actually run on, and
    stopping at ``None`` made that unanswerable exactly where it is recorded.

    **Why the last rung exists (review, 2026-09-08).**
    ``schedule_executions.model_used`` is written ONLY at row creation, and both
    portal paths pre-create the row, so ``execute_task``'s own
    ``model_used=model`` write (inside ``if not execution_id:``) never runs for
    a portal turn. Returning ``None`` therefore stamped the row NULL for the
    commonest case there is — no explicit pick, no agent override — while the
    turn ran on the platform default ``execute_task`` resolved a moment later.
    AC 7 says the model reaches the row; on the default path it did not, and the
    execution page AC 7 pairs with would have read blank for most Workspace
    turns. This is NOT a guessed default: it is
    ``settings_service.get_platform_default_model()``, the same function
    ``execute_task`` calls, so the row and the turn agree by construction and
    ``execute_task``'s resolution becomes a no-op rather than a second opinion.

    **The middle rung is a deliberate behaviour change, and it applies to EVERY
    portal turn — not only a platform user's.** ent#403 calls its absence the
    defect: a Workspace turn has always dispatched as ``triggered_by="public"``,
    so the owner's public-channel override was expected to apply here and never
    did. Gating the rung on the principal would leave the streaming route and
    the synchronous ent#83 route resolving differently, which is precisely the
    "two sources silently disagree" AC 5 exists to kill. So on deploy the model
    changes for existing external-client conversations wherever an owner set the
    override — recorded in `requirements/core-agent.md` §5.32 as the deliberate
    change it is.

    ``db.get_public_channel_model`` already degrades an allow-list-absent stored
    value to "unset" (#1080), which is why the roster's label runs the same check
    — the label and the turn must not disagree about one stale value.

    Never raises: a DB hiccup degrades to the platform default, never a failed
    turn. The requested value is returned as-is on that path because it is the
    user's explicit instruction, and dropping it silently would run the turn on
    a model they did not choose.

    it does not decide it).

    Order is load-bearing:

    1. **Normalise blank FIRST.** The control's default option has value ``""``,
       so ``""``, whitespace and an omitted field all mean *inherit*. Validating
       the raw field would 422 every default turn on day one — the same reason
       ``PUT /api/agents/{name}/public-channel-model`` normalises before it

    2. **Then the principal gate.** A caller with no control who sends a model is
       refused 403 rather than silently ignored: ignoring it would run the turn
       on something other than what was asked for and say nothing. The gate is
       ``is_platform`` — the same bit the roster's control renders on, so the UI
       and the door cannot disagree. A ent#163 delegated principal holds a portal
       SESSION, so it is ``is_platform=False`` and cannot pass here.
    3. **Then the closed allow-list.** ``WORKSPACE_MODELS``, never a regex and
       never a prefix check: the value reaches the agent as a ``--model`` argv
       element, so an arbitrary string is argv/flag-smuggling surface against
       the agent runtime — and the Workspace sends no model today, so this field

    to its chat.

    #2426: that claim used to be false, and it read as true. This site stamped
    the SURFACE and not the DESTINATION, so a synchronous turn landed with
    `source_channel='portal'` and a NULL `source_channel_chat_id`. ent#457 does
    pass the binding down, but `execute_task` persists it only inside
    `if not execution_id:` — and this function has already made the row and
    handed the id over, so that branch never runs. A child delegated during such
    a turn inherited a portal context with nowhere to go, and
    `report_completion` dropped it at its own `if not source_channel_chat_id`
    gate. Measured before the fix: 5 of 8 portal rows NULL, split exactly by
    path — the browser (streaming) stamped, `POST .../chat` did not.

    `session_id` is a required parameter rather than an optional one: the value
    is in scope at the only call site, and a default would let a future caller
    reintroduce the silent-inert row this fixes. ent#403's `resolved_model` is
    required for exactly the same reason, and it is the SAME BUG CLASS one field
    over: `schedule_executions.model_used` is written ONLY at row creation
    (`execute_task` persists it inside `if not execution_id:`), so a turn whose
    row was pre-created here lands with `model_used` NULL no matter what model
    the turn then runs on. Passing it as a turn kwarg alone would not fix it.

    Fail-soft to None: this exists so an addressed report finds its session, and
    a turn must not be refused because that bookkeeping could not be done. ONLY
    on that None path does `run_resumable_turn` create the row itself, exactly
    as before.

    On the success path the id is threaded through to `run_resumable_turn`, which
    ADOPTS the pre-created row rather than creating a second one — so this is not
    an orphan `running` row per synchronous portal turn (ent#365 review: the
    sentence above read as though the pre-created row went unused, and confirming

# the turn is already over. The agent has streamed its log all along
# (`GET /api/executions/{id}/stream`), and the backend already proxies exactly
# that for public links — the only missing piece was an id, early.
#
# So: create the execution row FIRST, hand the id back immediately, and run the
# same `portal_chat` coroutine as a background task. Deliberately NOT the #1083
# fire-and-forget path, which would have meant a lock lease, a cold retry split
# across a callback, and three terminal writes moving — plus it is
# `DISPATCH_ASYNC`-gated and Claude-only, so streaming would have been dark by
# default and absent on other runtimes. In-process, every runtime, no flag, and
# the turn logic does not move an inch.

#             one token covers the client's whole roster and there is no such
#             thing as logging them out of one agent. Non-destructive and
#             instantly reversible by the client (they can sign straight back
#             in), so any owner of an agent shared with them may do it.
#
#   block   — keep them out until an operator says otherwise. Admin-only,
#             because it denies access platform-wide and one agent's owner must
#             not be able to lock a client out of a different owner's agent.
#             Owners already hold a per-agent kill switch: unshare.
#
# Block is NOT delete (consistent with ent#21): history, threads and MEM-001
# memory are retained, so unblock restores access with the client's data intact.

# Deliberately permissive: this validates *shape*, so a typo'd address gets a
# named 422 instead of silently writing a block nobody will ever match. It is not
# an authorization check — the block only ever matters for an email that also has
# a share, and `agent_sharing` is the authority on that.
# Domain labels EXCLUDE the dot (`[^@\s.]`), which is what makes this linear.
# The previous form was `[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$`: since `[^@\s]` matches a
# dot, the two domain atoms were ambiguous and an input like `a@b.b.b.b…` forced
# polynomial backtracking (CodeQL py/polynomial-redos, surfaced the moment

    Derived from the resolved identity — never the comment — for the same reason
    `claim_capture_feedback_dispatch` excludes it: a key that moves with the text
    is not a dedup, it is a rename of the attack. `create_item` is an
    ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`` keyed on ``(agent_name, request_id)``,
    so a re-rate is a no-op.

    Hashed rather than interpolated: the id is matched against
    ``_RESERVED_ID_PREFIXES`` and validated by ``_ID_RE``
    (``^[A-Za-z0-9._:-]+$``), and an email is neither bounded nor confined to
    that alphabet — a raw one would be silently rejected at the sink for some
    addresses and not others. It also keeps the address out of a column the
    operator queue renders and the agent's own queue file can be synced with.

    **Quantised to the UTC day**, which is the review fix for a sharper problem
    than the one below: `create_item`'s ON CONFLICT ignores the existing row's
    STATUS, so once an operator had acknowledged a report that person could never
    raise another about that target — a second complaint was silently dropped,
    forever, which is worse than a duplicate. A day bucket keeps "never
    duplicates" true in the sense that matters (one item per person per target per
    day, whatever they click) while letting tomorrow's complaint through. It is
    the same bucketing ent#434's alert id uses, for the same reason.

    **Stated residual**: `create_item` still has no UPDATE path, so an edited
    comment does not reach an item already raised *that day*. That is the shared
    ent#434 residual and belongs at the sink — working around it here with a
