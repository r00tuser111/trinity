# Docker /health probe and OPTIONS preflight, with a grace path (empty token
# env → allow) for the non-breaking rollout. CORSMiddleware was removed: the
# agent server is internal-only (Docker network), never hit by a browser, so
# allow_origins=["*"] + allow_credentials=True was pure attack surface.

# #2114: when the boot baseline says subscription auth is active (truthy
# CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN on a Claude runtime), force-unset API-key-style auth
# from every spawn env — a stale .env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY otherwise shadows the
# subscription token at every spawn (Claude Code prefers the key). Boot-time,
# not module-import-time, so tests control INITIAL_ENV before arming.

# RELIABILITY-004 / #307: liveness heartbeat loop. Gated on TRINITY_BACKEND_URL
# + TRINITY_MCP_API_KEY both present, so old-image agents simply never beat.
schedule_heartbeat(app)

# #1083 fire-and-forget: on startup re-send any result-callback envelope left on
# disk by a crash/restart mid-callback, so completed work isn't lost to a phantom
# LEASE_EXPIRED. Gated on the same callback creds as the heartbeat.

# #817 follow-up: periodic cgroup orphan sweep. Catches orphans that
# escape the per-task cleanup path — specifically Eugene's production
# scenario where Trinity-side CB termination skips drain_reader_threads
# and subsequent tasks fast-fail before reaching the agent.
schedule_orphan_sweeper(app)

# #2455 (09-02 occurrence): the wedge is not a teardown artifact — the event
# loop stopped completing requests ~10 min BEFORE claude finished and ~3h
# before any drain branch could notice, while heartbeats kept the agent
# looking healthy. A beat task + watchdog THREAD is the only vantage point
# that can notice a wedged loop; past a 60s stall it dumps every thread's
# stack and the loop's task await-chains, re-dumping every 5 min while the
# stall persists, and logs the recovery that bounds the wedge window.
_schedule_loop_watchdog(app)

# #946 / #1081 Phase 2: agent-side pull worker pool. DEFAULT OFF — gated on the
# per-agent TRINITY_PULL_MODE flag (allowlist-injected by the backend). When off
# (every existing agent) this registers no startup handler and the push path is
# unchanged; when on, a bounded pool pulls work via /api/internal/next-task.
schedule_pull_workers(app)

# B6 fix (#1081): on startup re-send any pull terminal left on disk by a
# shutdown/deploy mid-delivery, so a completed-but-unreported turn isn't lost
# (the row would otherwise stay `running` → the lease reaper re-runs the whole
# turn from scratch). Mirrors schedule_pending_result_resend (#1083). Gated on
# the same worker creds; a no-op for any agent that never ran the pull pool.
