"""Execution environment assembly for spawned runtime subprocesses (#1999).

Before this module, `.env` and the environment executions actually received
were two independent channels. The credential endpoints mirrored every
submitted key into the **long-lived agent-server process's** `os.environ`, and
every spawn passed `env={**os.environ, ...}` — so the file an operator inspects
and the values a subprocess inherits synced only inside one code path, in one
direction, with no delete phase.

Consequence (the reported bug): a key removed from `.env` by any non-mirroring
write path — SSH, `docker exec`, or an agent editing its own `.env` — kept
reaching every subsequently-spawned execution until the container restarted.
Invisible to `/proc/<pid>/environ` (an exec-time snapshot; runtime `os.environ`
mutations never appear there) and to `docker exec` (which gets the container
baseline, not this process's mutated env). **Credential revocation silently
failed**, and both standard inspection routes agreed with the file while
disagreeing with reality.

The fix makes the execution environment a pure function of three inspectable
inputs, rebuilt per spawn rather than accumulated in process state:

    INITIAL_ENV          the container baseline captured at import — what
                         `docker exec` shows. Never mutated.
    .env                 parsed fresh at every spawn; authoritative for
                         credentials, so a deleted key is deleted.
    RUNTIME_OVERRIDES    a small named dict for values that are deliberately
                         NOT `.env` credentials — the #1089 subscription-token
                         rotation and the #2114 boot-time subscription-shadow
                         arm (`arm_subscription_auth_guard`).

`RUNTIME_OVERRIDES` is applied AFTER the file, deliberately diverging from the
issue's sketched ordering. `/api/credentials/reload-token` rotates the
subscription token *without* writing `.env` (by design — "the subscription
token is not a .env credential"), so if a stale `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` ever
appears in `.env` — an operator adding it by hand, a credential export that
captured it — file-last would silently serve the pre-rotation token and
re-open #1089 from the other side. An explicit hot-reload is the most recent
and most specific signal available; it wins. A `None` value means *force-unset*
(the `remove_api_key` case), which a plain dict merge cannot express.

No intra-package imports: this module is loadable standalone, so a test can
exercise it without importing the whole agent-server package.
