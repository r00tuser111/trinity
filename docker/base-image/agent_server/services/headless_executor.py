"""Headless task execution path for Claude Code.

Extracted from `claude_code.py` per #122 (issue split). Owns the
``execute_headless_task`` orchestrator plus three focused helpers
(setup, subprocess run, finalise) and the ``HeadlessRunContext`` dataclass
that carries state between them.

The orchestrator retains terminate authority on the outer ``asyncio.wait_for``
timeout — helpers mutate ``ctx`` but never own the process handle for cleanup
purposes. This preserves the L1877–1893 behaviour from the original
monolithic implementation: when the outer timeout fires (the safety net
above the inner ``process.wait`` budget), the orchestrator is the one that
calls ``ctx.terminate()`` and raises HTTP 504.

# for background subagents and workflows because "their result is part of the
# final output", but grants a background *shell* only a ~5s grace before killing
# it (measured: 5.09s). So a shell must never hold the finalize — that is #970's
# original problem domain (a lingering child holding the pipe), and gating on it
# would re-open the bug this gate preserves the fix for.
#
# Failure directions decide the shape: an allowlist that has not heard of a new
# waited type (a workflow) leaves #2127 in place for it, silently, which is the
# exact class being fixed. A denylist that has not heard of a new NON-waited type
# costs a bounded extra wait, floored by `effective_timeout`. Unknown types are
# counted and logged once so the vocabulary can be learned from production
# instead of guessed (learnings.md 2026-07-16: a guard inherits the blind spot of
# the one call form it was written against).

# theoretical — it is the shape the issue actually reports. Once the fan-out
# finishes, the ledger drains to `[]` while the model is still composing the
# synthesis those subagents were spawned to produce; the ledger says "idle" and
# the deliverable is still minutes away. Measured: 5 subagents reported by
# t+27.8s (ledger 0) and the real FINAL REPORT arrived at t+55.9s — a 28s window
# in which the ledger-only gate would have stood aside and let the kill land on
# "ECHO reported.".
#
# Output idleness is what #970's own failure actually is: claude ALIVE, blocked
# on an MCP stdio child, emitting nothing. "Still producing output" therefore
# separates the two cases directly, where the ledger only proxies for one of
# them.
#
# The value is set by what a HEALTHY run's longest silence can be. That is not
# thinking (`thinking_tokens` flows about every 1.6s) but the generation of one
# long assistant message: Trinity does not pass --include-partial-messages, so a
# message is a SINGLE stdout line emitted only when complete. Measured on Claude
# Code 2.1.220: a 9,840-char message = **40.54s of dead air** (vs a 7.33s worst
# gap across three fan-out runs), scaling at roughly 4ms/char.
#
# 300s is ~7.4x that measurement, and the error costs are wildly asymmetric:
# too LARGE only delays the pathological #970 finalize (still 24x better than
# the 2h wedge it replaced, and the answer is correct either way), while too
# SMALL destroys a finished deliverable and records it as success. Bias
