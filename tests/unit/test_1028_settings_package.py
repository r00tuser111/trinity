"""#1028 — `routers/settings` is a package, and the split changed no behaviour.

`routers/settings.py` was 3,529 lines: the largest file in the backend and
more than four times the 800-line critical threshold. It is now ten domain
modules composed onto one router.

The risk a decomposition like this carries is not "a handler broke" — each
handler still works when called directly, and its own unit test still passes.
The risk is **route registration order**. FastAPI matches in registration
order, so `GET /{key}` placed before `GET /ops/config` answers "setting not
found" for a route that plainly exists, and nothing that tests handlers in
isolation can see it.

So this file pins the two properties that survive a regrouping:

  * the mounted route SET is exactly what the single module mounted, and
  * no route can be shadowed by an earlier one.

It deliberately does NOT pin the literal order. Regrouping by domain reorders
specific routes relative to each other, and that is inert — two specific routes
only interfere when one can match the other's URL, which is what the shadowing
check below actually tests. Asserting the old order verbatim would fail on a
change that cannot affect a caller, and would have to be edited by hand every
time a route moves — a guard nobody trusts is a guard nobody keeps.

# The 60 routes `routers/settings.py` mounted at `dd910564`, the commit this
# split forked from — frozen here rather than read back out of git.
#
# The first version of this guard did `git show dd910564:…` at test time. That
# reads better and never runs: `.github/workflows/backend-unit-test.yml` pins
# `fetch-depth: 1` on every checkout, so the blob is unreachable on the runner
# and the comparison skipped on every CI run it has ever had — leaving the one
# property a 3,529 → 10 module split actually risks (a route silently lost or
# invented) proven nowhere. A guard that only runs on the author's machine is
# not a guard.
#
# A literal is the right shape for a *fork point*: it is a historical fact that
# cannot change, so freezing it costs nothing in maintenance. It is not a
# baseline that gets re-cut — a route added since the fork goes in
# `_ADDED_SINCE_SPLIT` below, one reviewed line at a time.
#
# `test_the_frozen_pre_split_set_matches_git` re-derives this from the real blob
# whenever history is deep enough (locally, and in any full-clone job), so the
# literal cannot quietly drift away from what it claims to transcribe.
