"""Static guard: docker-compose.hosted.yml never drifts from prod (#2280).

``docker-compose.hosted.yml`` is the pull-only twin of ``docker-compose.prod.yml``.
It exists because every marketplace and managed-host channel (#2281 DigitalOcean,
#2282 Vultr, #2283 Hostinger/Dokploy) rejects a compose file that builds, and
because a fresh VM must not spend 5-10 minutes compiling the agent base image on
first boot.

Two compose files describing one platform is *exactly* the shape of the bug this
repo has now shipped five times and named: a knob is added to one file and never
reaches the other, so the .env variable is silently inert in the deployment that
matters. `LOG_*` (#1039), VoIP's master switch (#1056), `AGENT_AUTH_SECRET`
(#1707), the container log caps (#1871), and — as recently as #2381 —
``ADMIN_USERNAME``, which was present in the dev compose and absent from prod, so
an ``ADMIN_USERNAME=root`` install silently kept provisioning ``admin``.

So the hosted file is *generated* from prod and *guarded* here, rather than
maintained by hand and trusted. The rule this enforces:

    hosted == prod, MINUS every `build:` block, PLUS a GHCR `image:` for the
    four images Trinity builds. Nothing else may differ — except the three
    ent#580 environment lines in ``_HOSTED_ONLY_ENV``, exact strings.

Deliberately compares the RAW yaml rather than ``docker compose config`` output:
the raw form still contains the unexpanded ``${VAR:-default}`` strings, so a
changed default (``VOIP_ENABLED:-false`` → ``:-true``) is a diff here, while the
resolved form would silently agree whenever the local .env happens to match.

Pure stdlib + PyYAML: no docker daemon, no backend import.

    variable present in prod but missing here is inert on exactly the installs
